      <description>I am a Research Fellow within Geography and Environmental Science at the University of Southampton. My principal research interests lie in the field of spatial planning and sustainable rural development. I am a postdoctoral research fellow in economic geography applied to rural territories. My current work looks at the impact of climate change on landscapes and livelihoods under different policy scenarios in the Mekong Delta using spatial modelling. I have a particular expertise in quantitative modelling applied to rural territories from a social, environmental and economic perspective.</description>

      <description>My work uses a combination of empirical spatial approach with participatory research and quantitative economic modelling to advance knowledge on sustainable and inclusive development of rural territories. The following is a summary of my ongoing research contributions and some information about my future research plans.

Current research My ongoing research into the economic analysis of rural territories examines how rural finance, agricultural marketing, access to resources, and land use patterns shape regional economic development and rural livelihood opportunities, especially in the context of climate change.</description>

      <description>In 2017, following the showcase of a video summarising my research at the yearly DECCMA Consortium Meeting, I was commissioned to designed and make an outreach video to present the outputs from the Climate Change and Vulnerability Handbook to the Governments and development practitioners of southern African countries. This work was produced following a collaboration between Kulima and CSIR. Please find below a link to the video.</description>

      <description>Social issues in rural India Inequalities are omnipresent within Indian rural communities. They are perpetuated by the system of castes, which leads to a social stratification of India’s population. Moreover, vulnerability to external stresses is also driven by gender discrimination, which follows on from the systemic marginalisation of women and the differences of power relationships that exist between men and women, especially in India. In order to get an overview of communities, social scientists have to face the challenge of getting access to the views of such marginalised groups.</description>

      <description>As part of DECCMA, a group of postgraduate research students has been established across the project partners. In total, there are about 20 PhD students working within the project, with a substantial and vibrant group of six based at the University of Southampton. Their work complements one another by examining how people are adapting to the physical effects of climate change, covering a broad range of topics from the physical aspects of deltas to their socio-economical dynamics.</description>

      <description>QGIS Tutorial QGIS is a well-developed, open source GIS program, with a wide range of features and great compatability with numerous formats. Furthermore, basic installation includes linkages with other open source GIS tools such as GRASS GIS and SAGA (among others). It is one primary software packages that I use in research and teach in classes.
This tutorial is designed to familiarize GIS users with the general layout, features and tools of QGIS, through working with sample datasets that are provided.</description>
