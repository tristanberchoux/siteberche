  <p>About nine months ago <a href="https://simplystatistics.org/2016/11/08/chromebook-part2/">I announced</a> that I was attempting a Chromebook experiment for the 2nd time. At first I thought it was going to be a short term experiment just to see if it was possible to function with only a Chromebook. But in an interesting twist I got used to it and have been working exclusively on a Chromebook for the last few months since the experiment started.</p>

<p>I set myself the following requirements:</p>

<ol>
<li>I could only use Chrome OS - no installing/booting to Linux</li>
<li>I couldn&rsquo;t use another computer for any task</li>
<li>I had to be &ldquo;fully cloudy&rdquo; in the sense that I didn&rsquo;t run any additional hardware</li>
</ol>

<p>One of the reasons I did this was I wanted to see if it was possible to be a functioning/day to day data scientist without using an expensive laptop. This is part of a broader experiment I&rsquo;m just beginning on how to <a href="https://peerj.com/preprints/3195/">democratize data science education</a>.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not going to go into extreme detail on how I set everything up here (more on that in a second) but I thought I&rsquo;d describe my Chromebook set up that I&rsquo;ve been using for the last couple of months.</p>

<p>I have been using two <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01LZ6XKS6">Samsung Chromebook Plus</a> computers, one of which I keep at home and one which I keep at work. One of the best parts about the fully cloudy/Chrome OS requirement is this means that from the user perspective everything is always in sync. I log off the computer at home, come to work, log on and its like I&rsquo;m on the same computer.</p>

<p>I thought I&rsquo;d just go through at a high level the software I&rsquo;m using to keep everything running.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Google Slides for presentations</strong> - <em>(Cost:free)</em> For the most part this has been really easy and is a smooth transition from Powerpoint. One thing I&rsquo;ve found really useful is the laser pointer mode of the Chromebook plus for highlighting things on screen when presenting. I have also found that since they are using USB-C adapters I can participate in <a href="https://simplystatistics.org/2011/09/23/dongle-communism/">dongle communism</a> with Apple users. I had to figure out the display mirroring menus in Chrome OS but after that this was easy.</li>
<li><strong>Google Docs/Paperpile for writing</strong> - <em>(Cost:free)</em> This works great and has been my work flow as I describe <a href="https://leanpub.com/modernscientist">in my book</a> since before the Chromebook experiment started.</li>
<li><strong>DocHub for signing things</strong> - <em>(Cost:\$4.99/month/billed yearly)</em> Often I have to &ldquo;sign&rdquo; a document by adding my electronic signature. I used the note feature to create a jpeg of my signature. I can then upload the file to Docub</li>
<li><strong>Overleaf for writing latex</strong> - <em>(Cost:free or \$10/month/billed yearly)</em>  This is not necessary for all data scientists, but it has some nice features, including when I could <a href="https://twitter.com/jtleek/status/856297030582497281">live write a grant</a> and people could watch.</li>
<li><strong>Gmail for email</strong> - <em>(Cost:free)</em> this one is pretty obvious.</li>
<li><strong>Google Sheets for data</strong> - <em>(Cost:free)</em> this is again a choice I had been making frequently before I moved to Chromebooks. The <a href="https://github.com/jennybc/googlesheets">googlesheets</a> R package lets you do <a href="https://simplystatistics.org/2016/08/26/googlesheets/">all sorts of cool things</a> with google sheets.</li>
<li><strong>Digital Ocean for Rstudio</strong> - _(Cost: \$20/mo)__ I set up an Rstudio server and run it remotely on Digital Ocean. I currently use the \$20/month option but sometimes scale it up or down as needed. One great thing about the dockerized version of the software is that I can pause the instance, scale up the compute infrastructre, restart and everything is just as I left it but with more computational horsepower. I can then use that for a few hours as needed and scale back down. I use the terminal in Rstudio for most of my management of code/etc. on Github.</li>
<li><strong>Google Hangouts for video conferencing</strong> - <em>(Cost:free)</em> this is the default but honestly I wish I had a better option. I often find it complicated and laggy to work with, but still mostly better than Skype. Would be open to suggestions on that front.</li>
<li><strong>Slack for communication</strong> <em>(Cost: \$6.67/month)</em> a variety of different teams here at JHU and around the country use Slack for group communication. I use it through the web browser, although the Chromebook Plus allows you to install Android apps.</li>
<li><strong>Google Music for listening to music/podcasts</strong> <em>(Cost:\$10/month)</em> This is an unnecesary expense but I like having something to listen to while I work.</li>
<li><strong>Tweetdeck for twitter</strong> - <em>(Cost:free)</em> I have a couple of accounts I manage and I do this through the web browser. For the most part this works great.</li>
</ul>

<p>So my total monthly cost comes to something like \$35 a month for various cloud services.
At first doing this was sort of like writing a Haiku. I could still write, but the constraints made me think hard about how I did things. But after a while I have gotten so used to the form that it feels natural and I don&rsquo;t miss my (really expensive) Apple products anymore.</p>

<p>The biggest headaches have been:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Wifi connectivity issues</strong> - this isn&rsquo;t as big as I thought it would be, most places have wifi where I work and it is mostly ok. When I have trouble I stream from my phone.</li>
<li><strong>Wifi blocking my DO server</strong> - this one has been a headache. I think if I just got a custom domain for the webserver and didn&rsquo;t just use the IP address I could avoid it. When I have trouble I stream from my phone.</li>
<li><strong>httr and Rstudio on a server</strong> - when I need to authenticate for websites I have run into trouble, but if I set <code>httr_oob_default==TRUE</code> (<a href="https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/217952868-Generating-OAuth-tokens-from-a-server">documentation here</a>) then the Oauth process generates a code I can paste into my server.</li>
</ul>

<p>Beyond that it has actually been pretty straightforward to do almost anything I need. Stay tuned because this experiment has inspired a broader effort we are doing with Chromebooks here at the <a href="http://jhudatascience.org/">JHU Data Science Lab</a>. If you want to hear about this effort as it gets underway, sign up for <a href="http://jhudatascience.us16.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=5ea551600fcdf84334e5aa6b0&amp;id=26c0b7221a">our weekly newsletter</a> and you&rsquo;ll be the first to hear new announcements.</p>
