      <description>Here&amp;#8217;s a question I get fairly frequently from various types of people: Where do you get your data? This is sometimes followed up quickly with &amp;#8220;Can we use some of your data?&amp;#8221;
My contention is that if someone asks you these questions, start looking for the exits.
There are of course legitimate reasons why someone might ask you this question. For example, they might be interested in the source of the data to verify its quality.</description>
