      <description>My colleagues and I just published a paper on validation of genomic results in BMC Bioinformatics. It is &amp;#8220;highly accessed&amp;#8221; and we are really happy with how it turned out. But it was brutal getting it published. Here is the line-up of places I sent the paper.  Science: Submitted 10/6/10, rejected 10/18/10 without review. I know this seems like a long shot, but this paper on validation was published in Science not too long after.</description>

      <description>The psychology/social psychology community has made replication a huge focus over the last year. One reason is the recent, public blow-up over a famous study that did not replicate. There are also concerns about the experimental and conceptual design of these studies that go beyond simple lack of replication. In genomics, a similar scandal occurred due to what amounted to &amp;#8220;data fudging&amp;#8221;. Although, in the genomics case, much of the blame and focus has been on lack of reproducibility or data availability.</description>
