<p><em>Editor&rsquo;s note: This post was written by Nick Carchedi, a Master&rsquo;s degree student in the Department of Biostatistics at Johns Hopkins. He is working with us to develop the <a href="http://jhudatascience.org">Data Science Specialization</a> as well as software for interactive learning of R and statistics.</em></p>

<p>Official swirl website: <a href="http://swirlstats.com">swirlstats.com</a></p>

<p>On September 27, 2013, I wrote a guest <a href="http://simplystatistics.org/2013/09/27/announcing-statistics-with-interactive-r-learning-software-environment/">blog post</a> on Simply Statistics to announce the creation of Statistics with Interactive R Learning (swirl), an R package for teaching and learning statistics and R simultaneously and interactively. Over the next several months, I received a tremendous amount of feedback from all over the world. Two things became clear: 1) there were many opportunities for improvement on the original design and 2) there&rsquo;s an incredible demand globally for new and better ways of learning statistics and R.</p>

<p>In the spirit of R and open source software, I shared the source code for swirl on GitHub. As a result, I quickly came in contact with several very talented individuals, without whom none of what I&rsquo;m about to share with you would have been possible. Armed with invaluable feedback and encouragement from early adopters of swirl 1.0, my new team and I pursued a complete overhaul of the original design.</p>

<p>Today, I&rsquo;m happy to announce the result of our efforts: swirl 2.0.</p>

<p>Like the first version of the software, swirl 2.0 guides students through interactive tutorials in the R console on a variety of topics related to statistics and R. The user selects from a menu of courses, each of which is broken up by topic into shorter lessons. Lessons, in turn, are a dialog between swirl and the user and are composed of text output, multiple choice and text-based questions, and (most importantly) questions that require the user to enter actual R code at the prompt. Responses are evaluated for correctness based on instructor-specified answer tests and appropriate feedback is given immediately to the user.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s helpful to think of swirl as the synthesis of two separate parts: content and platform. Content is authored by instructors in R Markdown files. The platform is then responsible for delivering this content to the user and interpreting the user&rsquo;s responses in an interactive and engaging way.</p>

<p>Our primary focus for swirl 2.0 was to build a more robust and extensible platform for delivering content. Here&rsquo;s a (nontechnical) summary of new and revised features:</p>

<ul>
<li>A library of answer tests an instructor can deploy to check user input for correctness</li>
<li>If stuck, a user can skip a question, causing swirl to enter the correct answer on their behalf</li>
<li>During a lesson, a user can pause instruction to play around or practice something they just learned, then use a special keyword to regain swirl&rsquo;s attention when ready to resume</li>
<li>swirl &ldquo;sees&rdquo; user input the same way R &ldquo;sees&rdquo; it, which allows swirl to understand the composition of a user&rsquo;s input on a much deeper level (thanks, Hadley)</li>
<li>User progress is saved between sessions</li>
<li>More readable output that adjusts to the width of the user&rsquo;s display (thanks again, Hadley)</li>
<li>Extensible framework allows others to easily extend swirl&rsquo;s functionality</li>
<li>Instructors can author content in a special flavor of R markdown</li>
</ul>

<p>(For a more technical understanding of swirl&rsquo;s features and inner workings, we encourage readers to consult our <a href="https://github.com/swirldev/swirl">GitHub repository</a>.)</p>

<p>Although improving the platform was our first priority for this release, we&rsquo;ve made some improvements to existing content and, more importantly, added the beginnings of a new course: Intro to R. Intro to R is our response to the overwhelming demand for a more accessible and interactive way to learn the R language. We&rsquo;ve included the first three lessons of the course and plan to add many more over the coming months as our focus turns to creating more high quality content.</p>

<p>Our ultimate goal is to have the statistics and R communities use swirl as a platform to deliver their own content to students interactively. We&rsquo;ve heard from many people who have an interest in creating their own content and we&rsquo;re working hard to make the process of creating content as simple and enjoyable as possible.</p>

<p>The goal of swirl is not to be flashy, but rather to provide the most authentic learning environment possible. We accomplish this by placing students directly on the R prompt, within the very same environment they&rsquo;ll use for data analysis when they are not using swirl. We hope you find swirl to be a valuable tool for learning and teaching statistics and R.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s important to stress that, as with any new software, we expect there will be bugs. At this point, users should still consider themselves &ldquo;early adopters&rdquo;. For bug reports, suggested enhancements, or to learn more about swirl, please visit <a href="http://swirlstats.com">our website</a>.</p>

<h2 id="contributors">Contributors:</h2>

<p>Many people have contributed to this project, either directly or indirectly, since its inception. I will attempt to list them all here, in no particular order. I&rsquo;m sincerely grateful to each and everyone one of you.</p>

<ul>
<li>Bill &amp; Gina: swirl is as much theirs as it is mine at this point. Their contributions are the only reason the project has evolved so much since the release of swirl 1.0.</li>
<li>Brian: Challenged me to turn my idea for swirl into a working prototype. Coined the &ldquo;swirl&rdquo; acronym. swirl would still be an idea in my head without his encouragement.</li>
<li>Jeff: Pushes me to think big picture and provides endless encouragement. Reminds me that a great platform is worthless without great content.</li>
<li>Roger: Encouraged me to separate platform and content, a key paradigm that allowed swirl to mature from a messy prototype to something of real value. Introduced me to Git and GitHub.</li>
<li>Lauren &amp; Ethan: Helped with development of the earliest instructional content.</li>
<li>Ramnath: Provided a model for content authoring via slidify &ldquo;flavor&rdquo; of R Markdown.</li>
<li>Hadley: Made key suggestions for improvement and provided an important <a href="https://gist.github.com/hadley/6734404">proof of concept</a>. His work has had a profound influence on swirl&rsquo;s development.</li>
<li>Peter: Our discussions led to a better understanding of some key ideas behind swirl 2.0.</li>
<li>Sally &amp; Liz: Beta testers and victims of my endless rants during stats tutoring sessions.</li>
<li>Kelly: Most talented graphic designer I know and mastermind behind the swirl logo. First line of defense against bad ideas, poor design, and crappy websites. Visit <a href="http://kellynealon.com">her website</a>.</li>
<li>Mom &amp; Dad: Beta testers and my #1 fans overall.</li>
