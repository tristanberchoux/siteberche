  <p>Data analysis workflows and recipes are commonly used in science. They
are actually indispensable since reinventing the wheel for each
project would result in a colossal waste of time. On the other hand,
mindlessly applying a workflow can result in
totally wrong conclusions if the required assumptions don&rsquo;t hold.
This is why successful data analysts rely heavily on interactive
data analysis (IDA). I write today because I am somewhat
concerned that the importance of IDA is not fully appreciated by many
of the policy makers and thought leaders that will influence how we
access and work with data in the future.</p>

<p>I start by constructing a very simple example to illustrate the
importance of IDA. Suppose that as
part of a demographic study you are asked to summarize male heights
across several counties. Since sample sizes are large and heights are
known to be well approximated by a normal distribution you feel
comfortable using a true and tested recipe:
report the average and standard deviation as a summary. You are
surprised to find a county with average heights of 6.1 feet with a
standard deviation (SD) of 7.8 feet. Do you start writing a paper and a
press release to describe this very interesting finding? Here,
interactive data analysis saves us from naively reporting this.
First, we note that the standard deviation is impossibly big if data is in
fact normally distributed: more than 15% of heights would be
negative. Given this nonsensical result, the next
obvious step for an experienced data analyst is to explore the data,
say with a boxplot (see below). This immediately reveals a problem, it
appears one value was reported in centimeters: 180 centimeters not
feet. After fixing this, the summary changes to an average height
of 5.75 and with a 3 inch SD.</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/simplystats/simplystats.github.io/master/_images/heights-with-outlier.png" alt="European Outlier" /></p>

<p>Years of data analysis experience will show you that examples like this are
common. Unfortunately, as data and analyses get more complex, workflow
failures are harder to detect and often go unnoticed. An important
principle many of us teach our trainees is to carefully check for
hidden problems when data analysis leads you to unexpected results,
especialy when the unexpected results holding up benefits us
professionally, for example by leading to a publication.</p>

<p>Interactive data analysis is also indispensable for the
development of new methodology. For example, in my field of research, exploring
the data has led to the discovery of the need for new methods and
motivated new approaches that handle specific cases that existing
workflows can&rsquo;t handle.</p>

<p>So why I am concerned?
As public datasets become larger and more
numerous, many funding agencies, policy makers and industry leaders are
advocating for using cloud computing to bring computing to the
data. If done correctly, this would provide a great improvement over
the current redundant and unsystematic approach of everybody downloading data and working with it locally. However, after
looking into the details of some of these plans, I have become a bit
concerned that perhaps the importance of IDA is not fully appreciated by decision makers.</p>

<p>As an example consider the NIH efforts to promote data-driven discovery
that center around plans for the
<a href="https://datascience.nih.gov/commons"><em>Data Commons</em></a>. The linked page
describes an ecosystem with four components one of which is
&ldquo;Software&rdquo;. According to the description, the software component of
<em>The Commons</em> should provide &ldquo;[a]ccess to and deployment of scientific analysis
tools and pipeline workflows&rdquo;. There is no mention of a strategy that
will grant access to the
raw data. Without this, carefully checking the workflow output and
developing the analysis tools and pipeline workflows of the future
will be difficult.</p>

<p>I note that data analysis workflows are very popular in fields in which data
analysis is indispensible, as is the case in biomedical research, my
focus area. In this field, data generators, which typically
lead the scientific enterprise, are not always trained data
analysts. But the literature is overflowing with proposed workflows.
You can gauge the popularity of these by the vast number
published in the nature journals as demonstrated by this
<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=workflow+site:nature.com&amp;biw=1706&amp;bih=901&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi3usL8-dDPAhUDMSYKHaBFBTAQ_AUIBigB#tbm=isch&amp;q=analysis+workflow+site:nature.com">google search</a>:</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/simplystats/simplystats.github.io/master/_images/many-workflows.png" alt="Nature workflows" /></p>

<p>In a field in which data generators are not data analysis experts, the
workflow has the added allure that it removes the need to think deeply about
data analysis and instead shifts the responsibility to pre-approved
software. Note that these workflows are not always described with the
mathematical language or computer coded needed to truly understand it
but rather with a series of PowerPoint shapes. The gist of the typical
data analysis workflow can be simplified into the following:</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/simplystats/simplystats.github.io/master/_images/workflow.png" alt="workflows" /></p>

<p>This simplification of the data analysis process makes it particularly
worrisome that the intricacies of IDA are not fully appreciated.</p>

<p>As mentioned above, data analysis workflows are a necessary component of
the scientific enterprise. Without them the process would slow down to
a halt. However, workflows should only be implemented once consensus
is reached regarding its optimality. And even then, IDA is needed to
assure that the process is performing as expected. The career of many of my
colleagues has been dedicated mostly to the development of such
analysis tools. We have learned that rushing to implement workflows
before they are mature enough can have widespread negative
consequences. And, at least in my experience, developing rigorous tools is
impossible without interactive data analysis. So I hope that this post
helps make a case for the importance of interactive data analysis and
that it continues to be a part of the scientific enterprise.</p>
