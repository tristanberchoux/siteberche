      <description>Up until about 20 years ago, postdocs were scarce in Statistics. In contrast, during the same time period, it was rare for a Biology PhD to go straight into a tenure track position.
Driven mostly by the availability of research funding for those working in applied areas, postdocs are becoming much more common in our field and I think this is great.Â It is great for PhD students to expand their horizons during two years in which they don&amp;#8217;t have to worry about teaching, committee meetings, or grant writing.</description>
