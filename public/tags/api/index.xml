      <description>This is the big one. ESPN has opened up access to their API!

      <description>Application programming interfaces (APIs) are tools that are built by companies/governments/organizations to allow software engineers to interact with their websites.

Using APIs, it is generally very easy to collect large amounts of interesting data. Here are some examples of APIs (you may need to sign up for accounts to get access to some of these).</description>
