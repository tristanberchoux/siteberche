      <description>Happy Father&amp;#8217;s Day!
 A really interesting read on randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and public policy. The examples in the boxes are fantastic. This seems to be one of the cases where the public policy folks are borrowing ideas from Biostatistics, which has been involved in randomized controlled trials for a long time. It&amp;#8217;s a cool example of adapting good ideas in one discipline to the specific challenges of another.Â  Roger points to this link in the NY Times about the &amp;#8220;Consumer Genome&amp;#8221;, which basically is a collection of information about your purchases and consumer history.</description>
