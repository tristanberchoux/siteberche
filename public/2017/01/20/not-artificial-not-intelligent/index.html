<p><em>Editor&rsquo;s note: This is the second chapter of a book I&rsquo;m working on called <a href="https://leanpub.com/demystifyai/">Demystifying Artificial Intelligence</a>. The goal of the book is to demystify what modern AI is and does for a general audience. So something to smooth the transition between AI fiction and highly mathematical descriptions of deep learning. I&rsquo;m developing the book over time - so if you buy the book on Leanpub know that there are only two chapters in there so far, but I&rsquo;ll be adding more over the next few weeks and you get free updates. The cover of the book was inspired by this <a href="https://twitter.com/notajf/status/795717253505413122">amazing tweet</a> by Twitter user <a href="https://twitter.com/notajf/">@notajf</a>. Feedback is welcome and encouraged!</em></p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;I am so clever that sometimes I don&rsquo;t understand a single word of
what I am saying.&rdquo; Oscar Wilde</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As we have described it artificial intelligence applications consist of
three things:</p>

<ol>
<li>A large collection of data examples</li>
<li>An algorithm for learning a model from that training set.</li>
<li>An interface with the world.</li>
</ol>

<p>In the following chapters we will go into each of these components in
much more detail, but lets start with a a couple of very simple examples
to make sure that the components of an AI are clear. We will start with
a completely artificial example and then move to more complicated
examples.</p>

<h2 id="building-an-album">Building an album</h2>

<p>Lets start with a very simple hypothetical example that can be
understood even if you don&rsquo;t have a technical background. We can also
use this example to define some of the terms we will be discussing later
in the book.</p>

<p>In our simple example the goal is to make an album of photos for a
friend. For example, suppose I want to take the photos in my photobook
and find all the ones that include pictures of myself and my son Dex for
his grandmother.</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/simplystats/simplystats.github.io/master/_images/cartoon-phone-photos.png" alt="The author's drawing of the author's phone album. Don't make fun, he's
a data scientist, not an artist" /></p>

<p>If you are anything like the author of this book, then you probably have
a very large number of pictures of your family on your phone. So the
first step in making the photo alubm would be to stort through all of my
pictures and pick out the ones that should be part of the album.</p>

<p>This is a typical example of the type of thing we might want to train a
computer to do in an artificial intelligence application. Each of the
components of an AI application is there:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>The data</strong>: all of the pictures on the author&rsquo;s phone (a big
training set!)</li>
<li><strong>The algorithm</strong>: finding pictures of me and my son Dex</li>
<li><strong>The interface</strong>: the album to give to Dex&rsquo;s grandmother.</li>
</ol>

<p>One way to solve this problem is for me to sort through the pictures one
by one and decide whether they should be in the album or not, then
assemble them together, and then put them into the album. If I did it
like this then I myself would be the AI! That wouldn&rsquo;t be very
artificial though&hellip;imagine we instead wanted to teach a computer to
make this album..</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But what does it mean to &ldquo;teach&rdquo; a computer to do something?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The terms &ldquo;machine learning&rdquo; and &ldquo;artificial intelligence&rdquo; invoke the
idea of teaching computers in the same way that we teach children. This
was a deliberate choice to make the analogy - both because in some ways
it is appropriate and because it is useful for explaining complicated
concepts to people with limited backgrounds. To teach a child to find
pictures of the author and his son, you would show her lots of examples
of that type of picture and maybe some examples of the author with other
kids who were not his son. You&rsquo;d repeat to the child that the pictures
of the author and his son were the kinds you wanted and the others
weren&rsquo;t. Eventually she would retain that information and if you gave
her a new picture she could tell you whether it was the right kind or
not.</p>

<p>To teach a machine to perform the same kind of recognition you go
through a similar process. You &ldquo;show&rdquo; the machine many pictures labeled
as either the ones you want or not. You repeat this process until the
machine &ldquo;retains&rdquo; the information and can correctly label a new photo.
Getting the machine to &ldquo;retain&rdquo; this information is a matter of getting
the machine to create a set of step by step instructions it can apply to
go from the image to the label that you want.</p>

<h2 id="the-data">The data</h2>

<p>The images are what people in the fields of artificial intelligence and
machine learning call <em>&ldquo;raw data&rdquo;</em> (Leek, n.d.). The categories of
pictures (a picture of the author and his son or a picture of something
else) are called the <em>&ldquo;labels&rdquo;</em> or <em>&ldquo;outcomes&rdquo;</em>. If the computer gets to
see the labels when it is learning then it is called <em>&ldquo;supervised
learning&rdquo;</em> (Wikipedia contributors 2016) and when the computer doesn&rsquo;t
get to see the labels it is called <em>&ldquo;unsupervised learning&rdquo;</em> (Wikipedia
contributors 2017a).</p>

<p>Going back to our analogy with the child, supervised learning would be
teaching the child to recognize pictures of the author and his son
together. Unsupervised learning would be giving the child a pile of
pictures and asking them to sort them into groups. They might sort them
by color or subject or location - not necessarily into categories that
you care about. But probably one of the categories they would make would
be pictures of people - so she would have found some potentially useful
information even if it wasn&rsquo;t exactly what you wanted. One whole field
of artificial intelligence is figuring out how to use the information
learned in this &ldquo;unsupervised&rdquo; setting and using it for supervised tasks
- this is sometimes called <em>&ldquo;transfer learning&rdquo;</em> (Raina et al. 2007) by
people in the field since you are transferring information from one task
to another.</p>

<p>Returning to the task of &ldquo;teaching&rdquo; a computer to retain information
about what kind of pictures you want we run into a problem - computers
don&rsquo;t know what pictures are! They also don&rsquo;t know what audio clips,
text files, videos, or any other kind of information is. At least not
directly. They don&rsquo;t have eyes, ears, and other senses along with a
brain designed to decode the information from these senses.</p>

<p>So what can a computer understand? A good rule of thumb is that a
computer works best with numbers. If you want a computer to sort
pictures into an album for you, the first thing you need to do is to
find a way to turn all of the information you want to &ldquo;show&rdquo; the
computer into numbers. In the case of sorting pictures into albums - a
supervised learning problem - we need to turn the labels and the images
into numbers the computer can use.</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/simplystats/simplystats.github.io/master/_images/labels-to-numbers.png" alt="Label each picture as a one or a zero depending on whether it is the
kind of picture you want in the album" /></p>

<p>One way to do that would be for you to do it for the computer. You could
take every picture on your phone and label it with a 1 if it was a
picture of the author and his son and a 0 if not. Then you would have a
set of 1&rsquo;s and 0&rsquo;s corresponding to all of the pictures. This takes some
thing the computer can&rsquo;t understand (the picture) and turns it into
something the computer can understand (the label).</p>

<p>This process would turn the labels into something a computer could
understand, it still isn&rsquo;t something we could teach a computer to do.
The computer can&rsquo;t actually &ldquo;look&rdquo; at the image and doesn&rsquo;t know who the
author or his son are. So we need to figure out a way to turn the images
into numbers for the computer to use to generate those labels directly.</p>

<p>This is a little more complicated but you could still do it for the
computer. Let&rsquo;s suppose that the author and his son always wear matching
blue shirts when they spend time together. Then you could go through and
look at each image and decide what fraction of the image is blue. So
each picture would get a number ranging from zero to one like 0.30 if
the picture was 30% blue and 0.53 if it was 53% blue.</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/simplystats/simplystats.github.io/master/_images/images-to-numbers.png" alt="Calculate the fraction of each image that is the color blue as a
&quot;feature&quot; of the image that is numeric" /></p>

<p>The fraction of the picture that is blue is called a <em>&ldquo;feature&rdquo;</em> and the
process of creating that feature is called <em>&ldquo;feature engineering&rdquo;</em>
(Wikipedia contributors 2017b). Until very recently feature engineering
of text, audio, or video files was best performed by an expert human. In
later chapters we will discuss how one of the most exciting parts about
AI application is that it is now possible to have computers perform
feature engineering for you.</p>

<h2 id="the-algorithm">The algorithm</h2>

<p>Now that we have converted the images to numbers and the labels to
numbers, we can talk about how to &ldquo;teach&rdquo; a computer to label the
pictures. A good rule of thumb when thinking about algorithms is that a
computer can&rsquo;t &ldquo;do&rdquo; anything without being told very explicitly what to
do. It needs a step by step set of instructions. The instructions should
start with a calculation on the numbers for the image and should end
with a prediction of what label to apply to that image. The image
(converted to numbers) is the <em>&ldquo;input&rdquo;</em> and the label (also a number) is
the <em>&ldquo;output&rdquo;</em>. You may have heard the phrase:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Garbage in, garbage out&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What this phrase means is if the inputs (the images) are bad - say they
are all very dark or hard to see. Then the output of the algorithm will
also be bad - the predictions won&rsquo;t be very good.</p>

<p>A machine learning <em>&ldquo;algorithm&rdquo;</em> can be thought of as a set of
instructions with some of the parts left blank - sort of like mad-libs.
One example of a really simple algorithm for sorting pictures into the
album would be:</p>

<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Calculate the fraction of blue in the image.</li>
<li>If the fraction of blue is above <em>X</em> label it 1</li>
<li>If the fraction of blue is less than <em>X</em> label it 0</li>
<li>Put all of the images labeled 1 in the album</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>

<p>The machine <em>&ldquo;learns&rdquo;</em> by using the examples to fill in the blanks in
the instructions. In the case of our really simple algorithm we need to
figure out what fraction of blue to use (<em>X</em>) for labeling the picture.</p>

<p>To figure out a guess for <em>X</em> we need to decide what we want the
algorithm to do. If we set <em>X</em> to be too low then all of the images will
be labeled with a 1 and put into the album. If we set <em>X</em> to be too high
then all of the images will be labeled 0 and none will appear in the
album. In between there is some grey area - do we care if we
accidentally get some pictures of the ocean or the sky with our
algorithm?</p>

<p>But the number of images in the album isn&rsquo;t even the thing we really
care about. What we might care about is making sure that the album is
mostly pictures of the author and his son. In the field of AI they
usually turn this statement around - we want to make sure the album has
a very small fraction of pictures that are not of the author and his
son. This fraction - the fraction that are incorrectly placed in the
album is called the <em>&ldquo;loss&rdquo;</em>. You can think about it like a game where
the computer loses a point every time it puts the wrong kind of picture
into the album.</p>

<p>Using our loss (how many pictures we incorrectly placed in the album) we
can now use the data we have created (the numbers for the labels and the
images) to fill in the blanks in our mad-lib algorithm (picking the
cutoff on the amount of blue). We have a large number of pictures where
we know what fraction of each picture is blue and whether it is a
picture of the author and his son or not. We can try each possible <em>X</em>
and calculate the fraction of pictures in the album that are incorrectly
placed into the album (the loss) and find the <em>X</em> that produces the
smallest fraction.</p>

<p>Suppose that the value of <em>X</em> that gives the smallest faction of wrong
pictures in the album is 30. Then our &ldquo;learned&rdquo; model would be:</p>

<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Calculate the fraction of blue in the image</li>
<li>If the fraction of blue is above 0.1 label it 1</li>
<li>If the fraction of blue is less than 0.1 label it 0</li>
<li>Put all of the images labeled 1 in the album</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="the-interface">The interface</h2>

<p>The last part of an AI application is the interface. In this case, the
interface would be the way that we share the pictures with Dex&rsquo;s
grandmother. For example we could imagine uploading the pictures to
<a href="https://www.shutterfly.com/">Shutterfly</a> and having the album delivered
to Dex&rsquo;s grandmother.</p>

<p>Putting this all together we could imagine an application using our
trained AI. The author uploads his unlabeled photos. The photos are then
passed to the computer program which calculates the fraction of the
image that is blue, then applies a label according to the algorithm we
learned, then takes all the images predicted to be of the author and his
son and sends them off to be a Shutterfly album mailed to the authors&rsquo;
mother.</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/simplystats/simplystats.github.io/master/_images/ai-album.png" alt="Whoa that computer is smart - from the author's picture to grandma's
hands!" /></p>

<p>If the algorithm was good, then from the perspective of the author the
website would look &ldquo;intelligent&rdquo;. I just uploaded pictures and it
created an album for me with the pictures that I wanted. But the steps
in the process were very simple and understandable behind the scenes.</p>
