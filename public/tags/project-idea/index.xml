      <description>We all know that politicians can play it a little fast and loose with the truth. This is particularly true in debates, where politicians have to think on their feet and respond to questions from the audience or from each other.Â Usually, we find out about how truthful politicians are in the &amp;#8220;post-game show&amp;#8221;. The discussion of the veracity of the claims is usually based on independent fact checkers such as PolitiFact.</description>
