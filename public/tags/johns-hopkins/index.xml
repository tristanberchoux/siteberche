      <description>The US News best hospital 2012-20132 rankings are out. The big news is that Johns Hopkins has lost its throne. For 21 consecutive years Hopkins was ranked #1, but this year Mass General HospitalÂ (MGH) took the top spot displacing Hopkins to #2. However, Elisabet Pujadas, an MD-PhD student here at Hopkins, took a close look at the data used for the rankings and made this plot (by hand!). The plot shows histograms of the rankings by speciality and shows Hopkins outperforming MGH.</description>
