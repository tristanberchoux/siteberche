      <description>A cool article on Github by the folks at Wired. I&amp;#8217;m starting to think the fact that I&amp;#8217;m not on Github is a serious dent in my nerd cred.Â  Datawrapper - a less intensive, but less flexible open source data visualization creator. I have seen a few of these types of services starting to pop up. I think that some statistics training should be mandatory before people use them.</description>

      <description>Over the last week or so I&amp;#8217;ve been posting about the air pollution levels in Beijing, China. The twitter feed from the US Embassy there makes it easy to track the hourly levels of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and you can use this R code to make a graph of the data.
One problem with talking about particulate matter levels is that the units are a bit abstract. We usually talk in terms of micrograms per cubic meter (mcg/m^3), which is a certain mass of particles per volume of air.</description>
