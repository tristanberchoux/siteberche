      <description>Simply Statistics has had the same logo since Roger grabbed the first picture in his results folder that looked &amp;#8220;statistics related&amp;#8221;. While we do have some affection for the logo, we would like something a little more catchy.
So we would like to announce a contest to create our newÂ logo. Here are the rules:
 All submissions must be sent to Roger with the email subject, &amp;#8220;Simply Statistics Logo Contest&amp;#8221; The logo must be generated with reproducible R code.</description>
