description: Climate Risk and Vulnerability
---

In 2017, following the showcase of a [video summarising my research](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzabZybR4pY) at the yearly [DECCMA](http://deccma.com) Consortium Meeting, I was commissioned to designed and make an outreach video to present the outputs from the Climate Change and Vulnerability Handbook to the Governments and development practitioners of southern African countries. This work was produced following a collaboration between [Kulima](http://kulima.com) and [CSIR](http://csir.co.za). Please find below a link to the video.
