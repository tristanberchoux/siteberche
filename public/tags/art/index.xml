      <description>An interview with Anthony Goldbloom, CEO of Kaggle. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure I&amp;rsquo;d agree with the characterization that all data scientists are: creative, curious, and competitive and certainly those characteristics aren&amp;rsquo;t unique to data scientists. And I didn&amp;rsquo;t know this: &amp;ldquo;We have 65,000 data scientists signed up to Kaggle, and just like with golf tournaments, we have them all ranked from 1 to 65,000.&amp;ldquo;  Check it out, art with R!</description>

      <description>Mark Hansen is easily one of my favorite statisticians today. He is a Professor of Statistics at UCLA and his collaborations with artists have brought data visualization to a whole new place, one that is both informative and moving. Here is a video of his project with Ben Rubin called Listening Post. The installation grabs conversations from unrestricted chat rooms and processes them in real-time to create interesting &amp;#8220;themes&amp;#8221; or &amp;#8220;movements&amp;#8221;.</description>
