      <description>I have been getting some questions via email, LinkedIn, and Twitter about the content of the Data Analysis class I will be teaching for Coursera. Data Analysis and Data Science mean different things to different people. So I made a video describing how Data Analysis fits into the landscape of other quantitative classes here:
Here is the corresponding presentation. I also made a tentative list of topics we will cover, subject to change at the instructor&amp;rsquo;s whim.</description>

      <description>I just saw this really nice post over on John Cook&amp;rsquo;s blog. He talks about how it is a valuable exercise to re-type code for examples you find in a book or on a blog. I completely agree that this is a good way to learn through osmosis, learn about debugging, and often pick up the reasons for particular coding tricks (this is how I learned about vectorized calculations in Matlab, by re-typing and running my advisors code back in my youth).</description>

      <description>Some interesting data/data visualizations about working conditions in the apparel industry. Here is the full report. Whenever I see reports like this, I wish the raw data were more clearly linked. I want to be able to get in, play with the data, and see if I notice something that doesn&amp;rsquo;t appear in the infographics.  This is an awesome plain-language discussion of how a bunch of methods (CS and Stats) with fancy names relate to each other.</description>

      <description>I just finished teaching a Ph.D. level applied statistical methods course here at Hopkins. As part of the course, I gave one &amp;#8220;pro-tip&amp;#8221; a day; something I wish I had learned in graduate school that has helped me in becoming a practicing applied statistician. Here are the first three, more to come soon.   A major component of being a researcher is knowing what&amp;#8217;s going on in the research community.</description>

      <description>It&amp;#8217;s grant season around here so I&amp;#8217;ll be brief:   I love this article in the WSJ about the crisis at JP Morgan. The key point it highlights is that looking only at the high-level analysis and summaries can be misleading, you have to look at the raw data to see the potential problems. As data become more complex, I think its critical we stay in touch with the raw data, regardless of discipline.</description>
