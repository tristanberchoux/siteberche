      <title>Does NIH fund innovative work?  Does Nature care about publishing accurate articles?</title>

      <description>_Editor&amp;rsquo;s Note: In a recent post we disagreed with a Nature article claiming that NIH doesn&amp;rsquo;t support innovation. Our colleague Steven Salzberg actually looked at the data and wrote the guest post below. _
Nature published an article last month with the provocative title &amp;ldquo;Research grants: Conform and be funded.&amp;rdquo; The authors looked at papers with over 1000 citations to find out whether scientists &amp;ldquo;who do the most influential scientific work get funded by the NIH.</description>

      <title>What&#39;s wrong with the predicting h-index paper.</title>

      <description>_Editor&amp;#8217;s Note: I recently posted about a paper in Nature that purported to predict the H-index. The authors contacted me to get my criticisms, then responded to those criticisms. They have requested the opportunity to respond publicly, and I think it is a totally reasonable request. Until there is a better comment generating mechanism at the journal level, this seems like as good a forum as any to discuss statistical papers.</description>

      <title>A disappointing response from @NatureMagazine about folks with statistical skills</title>

      <description>Last week I linked to an ad for a Data Editor position at Nature Magazine. I was super excited that Nature was recognizing data as an important growth area. But the ad doesn&amp;#8217;t mention anything about statistical analysis skills; it focuses exclusively on data management expertise. As I pointed out in the earlier post, managing data is only half the equation - figuring out what to do with the data is the other half.</description>

      <title>Nature is hiring a data editor...how will they make sense of the data?</title>

      <description>It looks like the journal Nature is hiring a Chief Data Editor (link via Hilary M.). It looks like the primary purpose of this editor is to develop tools for collecting, curating, and distributing data with the goal of improving reproducible research.
The main duties of the editor, as described by the ad are:  Nature Publishing Group is looking for a Chief Editor to develop a product aimed at making research data more available, discoverable and interpretable.</description>

      <title>When should statistics papers be published in Science and Nature?</title>

      <description>Like many statisticians, I was amped to see a statistics paper appear in Science. Given the impact that statistics has on the scientific community, it is a shame that more statistics papers don&amp;#8217;t appear in the glossy journals like Science or Nature. As I pointed out in the previous post, if the paper that introduced the p-value was cited every time this statistic was used, the paper would have over 3 million citations!</description>
