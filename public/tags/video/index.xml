      <description>I have been getting some questions via email, LinkedIn, and Twitter about the content of the Data Analysis class I will be teaching for Coursera. Data Analysis and Data Science mean different things to different people. So I made a video describing how Data Analysis fits into the landscape of other quantitative classes here:
Here is the corresponding presentation. I also made a tentative list of topics we will cover, subject to change at the instructor&amp;rsquo;s whim.</description>

      <description>Mark Hansen is easily one of my favorite statisticians today. He is a Professor of Statistics at UCLA and his collaborations with artists have brought data visualization to a whole new place, one that is both informative and moving.Â Here is a video of his project with Ben Rubin called Listening Post. The installation grabs conversations from unrestricted chat rooms and processes them in real-time to create interesting &amp;#8220;themes&amp;#8221; or &amp;#8220;movements&amp;#8221;.</description>

&amp;#8220;Any other team wins the World Series, good for them&amp;#8230;if we win, with this team &amp;#8230; we&amp;#8217;ll have changed the game.&amp;#8221;
Moneyball! Maybe the start of the era of data. Plus it is a feel good baseball movie where a statistician is the hero. I haven&amp;#8217;t been this stoked for a movie in a long time.
