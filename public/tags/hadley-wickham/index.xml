      <description>This is yet another outstanding post by Paul Graham, this time on &amp;#8220;Schlep Blindness&amp;#8221;. He talks about how there are great startup ideas that no one considers because they are too much of a &amp;#8220;schlep&amp;#8221; (a tedious unpleasant task). He talks about how most founders of startups want to put up a clever bit of code they wrote and just watch the money flow in. But of course it doesn&amp;#8217;t work like that, you need to advertise, interact with customers, raise money, go out and promote your work, fix bugs at 3am, etc.</description>

      <description>Patenting statistical sampling? I&amp;#8217;m pretty sure the Supreme Court who threw out the Mayo Patent wouldn&amp;#8217;t have much trouble tossing this patent either. The properties of sampling are a &amp;#8220;law of nature&amp;#8221; right? via Leonid K. This video has me all fired up, its called 23&amp;#160;1&amp;frasl;2 hours and talks about how the best preventative health measure is getting 30 minutes of exercise - just walking - every day. He shows how in some cases this beats doing much more high-tech interventions.</description>
