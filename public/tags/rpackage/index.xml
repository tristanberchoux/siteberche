      <description>A few years ago I helped write a paper where we proposed scraping p-values from the medical literature to try to estimate the science-wise false discovery rate. The paper generated a ton of interesting discussion and inspired other groups to start collecting p-values from the literature.
As I&amp;rsquo;ve mentioned before the p-value is the most popular statistic ever invented so there are a lot of published p-values out there.
The tidypvals package is an effort to find previous collections of published p-values, synthesize them, and tidy them into one analyzable data set.</description>
