I am currently working with Professor Steve Darby and Professor Craig Hutton on the project “Building Resilient Agricultural Systems: Sustainable Livelihoods in Mega Deltas Under Environmental Change (BRAgS).” The project is funded by the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council under a GCRF Foundation Award for Global Agriculture and Food Systems Research. The aim of the project is to establish a new international and multidisciplinary collaboration between UK and Vietnamese universities, international agencies and key end users that is capable of delivering new insight into the trade-offs between flooding, sediment and nutrient deposition, agricultural systems and associated livelihood strategies in the Vietnamese Mekong Delta.

### Research interests

- **Economic geography** (livelihoods, employment, territorial impact of climate change, quantitative modelling of rural territories, political economy of livelihoods)
- **Landscape planning and land systems** (policies, management)
- **Agricultural economics** (agricultural prices, markets, family farming, microfinance, migration)
