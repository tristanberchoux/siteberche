      <description>Google scholar has now made Google Scholar Citations profiles available to anyone. You can read about these profiles and set one up for yourself here.
I asked John Muschelli and Andrew Jaffeto write me a function that would download my Google Scholar Citations data so I could play with it. Then they got all crazy on it and wrote a couple of really neat functions. All cool/interesting components of these functions are their ideas and any bugs were introduced by me when I was trying to fiddle with the code at the end.</description>
