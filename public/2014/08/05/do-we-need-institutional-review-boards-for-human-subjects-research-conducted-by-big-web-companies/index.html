  <p>Web companies have been doing human subjects research for a while now. Companies like Facebook and Google have employed statisticians for almost a decade (or more) and part of the culture they have introduced is the idea of randomized experiments to identify ideas that work and that don&rsquo;t. They have figured out that experimentation and statistical analysis often beat out the opinion of the highest paid person at the company for identifying features that &ldquo;work&rdquo;. Here &ldquo;work&rdquo; may mean features that cause people to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_F5GxCwizc">read advertising</a>, or <a href="http://www.cnet.com/news/google-starts-placing-ads-directly-in-gmail-inboxes/">click on ads</a>, or <a href="http://blog.okcupid.com/index.php/we-experiment-on-human-beings/">match up with more people</a>.</p>

<p>This has created a huge amount of value and definitely a big interest in the statistical community. For example, today&rsquo;s session on &ldquo;Statistics: The Secret Weapon of Successful Web Giants&rdquo; was standing room only.</p>

<p>But at the same time, these experiments have raised some issues.

The IRBs are designed to consider the ethical issues involved with performing research on humans to balance protection of rights with advancing science.</p>

<p>Facebook, OK Cupid, and other companies are not subject to IRB approval. Yet they are performing more and more human subjects experiments. Obviously the studies described in the Facebook paper and the OK Cupid post pale in comparison to the Tuskegee study. I also know scientists at these companies and know they are ethical and really trying to do the right thing. But it raises interesting questions about oversight. Given the emotional, professional, and economic value that these websites control for individuals around the globe, it may be time to discuss whether it is time to consider the equivalent of &ldquo;institutional review boards&rdquo; for human subjects research conducted by companies.</p>

<p>Companies who test drugs on humans such as Merck are subject to careful oversight and regulation to prevent potential harm to patients during the discovery process. This is obviously not the optimal solution for speed - understandably a major advantage and goal of tech companies. But there are issues that deserve serious consideration. For example, I think it is no where near sufficient to claim that by signing the terms of service that people have given informed consent to be part of an experiment. That being said, they could just stop using Facebook if they don&rsquo;t like that they are being experimented on.</p>

<p>Our reliance on these tools for all aspects of our lives means that it isn&rsquo;t easy to just tell people, &ldquo;Well if you don&rsquo;t like being experimented on, don&rsquo;t use that tool.&rdquo; You would have to give up at minimum Google, Gmail, Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram to avoid being experimented on. But you&rsquo;d also have to give up using smaller sites like OK Cupid, because almost all web companies are recognizing the <a href="http://simplystatistics.org/2014/05/07/why-big-data-is-in-trouble-they-forgot-about-applied-statistics/">importance of statistics</a>. One good place to start might be in considering <a href="http://biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2014/06/25/006601.full.pdf">new and flexible forms of consent</a> that make it possible to opt in and out of studies in an informed way, but with enough speed and flexibility not to slowing down the innovation in tech companies.</p>
