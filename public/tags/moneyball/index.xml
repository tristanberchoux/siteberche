      <description>There has been a lot of talk about the Michael Lewis (of Moneyball fame) profile of Obama in Vanity fair. One interesting quote I think deserves a lot more discussion is: &amp;#8220;On top of all of this, after you have made your decision, you need to feign total certainty about it. People being led do not want to think probabilistically.&amp;#8221; This is a key issue that is only going to get worse going forward.</description>
