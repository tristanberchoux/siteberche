      <description>Jeff recently posted links to data from cities and states. He and I wrote R code that plots gun offender locations for Baltimore. Specifically we plot the locations that appear on this table. I added locations of the Baltimore neighborhoods where most of our Hopkins colleagues live as well as the location of the medical institutions where we work. Note the corridor with no points between the West side (Barksdale territory) and East side (Prop Joe territory).</description>

      <description>It&amp;#8217;s the beginning of 2012 and statistics/data science has never been hotter. Some of the most important data is data collected about civic organizations. If you haven&amp;#8217;t seen Bill Gate&amp;#8217;s TED Talk about the importance of state budgets, you should watch it now. A major key to solving a lot of our economic problems lies in understanding and using data collected about cites and states.Â U.S. cities and states are jumping on this idea and our own Baltimore was one of the earliest adopters.</description>
