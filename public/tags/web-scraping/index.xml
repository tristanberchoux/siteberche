      <description>Google scholar has now made Google Scholar Citations profiles available to anyone. You can read about these profiles and set one up for yourself here.
I asked John Muschelli and Andrew Jaffeto write me a function that would download my Google Scholar Citations data so I could play with it. Then they got all crazy on it and wrote a couple of really neat functions. All cool/interesting components of these functions are their ideas and any bugs were introduced by me when I was trying to fiddle with the code at the end.</description>

      <description>The internet is the greatest source of publicly available data. One of the key skills to being able to obtain data from the web is &amp;#8220;web-scraping&amp;#8221;, where you use a piece of software to run through a website and collect information. This technique can be used for collecting data from databases or to collect data that is scattered across a website. Here is a very cool little exercise in web-scraping that can be used as an example of the things that are possible.</description>
