  <p>_Editor&rsquo;s note: <a href="http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~wainwrig/">Martin Wainwright</a> is the winner of the 2014 COPSS Award. This award is the most prestigious award in statistics, sometimes refereed to as the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COPSS_Presidents'_Award">Nobel Prize in Statistics</a>. Martin received the award for: &ldquo;<span style="color: #222222;"> For fundamental and groundbreaking contributions to high-dimensional statistics, graphical modeling, machine learning, optimization and algorithms, covering deep and elegant mathematical analysis as well as new methodology with wide-ranging implications for numerous applications.&rdquo; He kindly agreed to be interviewed by Simply Statistics. </span>_</p>

<p><strong>SS: How did you find out you had received the COPSS prize?</strong></p>

<p>It was pretty informal -&ndash; I received an email in February from</p>

<p>Raymond Carroll, who chaired the committee. But it had explicit</p>

<p>instructions to keep the information private until the award ceremony</p>

<p>in August.</p>

<p><strong>SS: You are in Electrical Engineering &amp; Computer Science (EECS) and</strong></p>

<p><strong>Statistics at Berkeley: why that mix of departments?</strong></p>

<p>Just to give a little bit of history, I did my undergraduate degree in</p>

<p>math at the University of Waterloo in Canada, and then my Ph.D. in</p>

<p>EECS at MIT, before coming to Berkeley to work as a postdoc in</p>

<p>Statistics. So when it came time to looking at faculty positions,</p>

<p>having a joint position between these two departments made a lot of</p>

<p>sense. Berkeley has always been at the forefront of having effective</p>

<p>joint appointments of the &ldquo;Statistics plus X&rdquo; variety, whether X is</p>

<p>EECS, Mathematics, Political Science, Computational Biology and so on.</p>

<p>For me personally, the EECS plus Statistics combination is terrific,</p>

<p>as a lot of my interests lie at the boundary between these two areas,</p>

<p>whether it is investigating tradeoffs between computational and</p>

<p>statistical efficiency, connections between information theory and</p>

<p>statistics, and so on. I hope that it is also good for my students!</p>

<p>In any case, whether they enter in EECS or Statistics, they graduate</p>

<p>with a strong background in both statistical theory and methods, as</p>

<p>well as optimization, algorithms and so on. I think that this kind of</p>

<p>mix is becoming increasingly relevant to the practice of modern</p>

<p>statistics, and one can certainly see that Berkeley consistently</p>

<p>produces students, whether from my own group or other people at</p>

<p>Berkeley, with this kind of hybrid background.</p>

<p><strong>SS: What do you see as the relationship between statistics and machine</strong></p>

<p><strong>learning?</strong></p>

<p>This is an interesting question, but tricky to answer, as it can</p>

<p>really depend on the person. In my own view, statistics is a very</p>

<p>broad and encompassing field, and in this context, machine learning</p>

<p>can be viewed as a particular subset of it, one especially focused on</p>

<p>algorithmic and computational aspects of statistics. But on the other</p>

<p>hand, as things stand, machine learning has rather different cultural</p>

<p>roots than statistics, certainly strongly influenced by computer</p>

<p>science. In general, I think that both groups have lessons to learn</p>

<p>from each other. For instance, in my opinion, anyone who wants to do</p>

<p>serious machine learning needs to have a solid background in</p>

<p>statistics. Statisticians have been thinking about data and</p>

<p>inferential issues for a very long time now, and these fundamental</p>

<p>issues remain just as important now, even though the application</p>

<p>domains and data types may be changing. On the other hand, in certain</p>

<p>ways, statistics is still a conservative field, perhaps not as quick</p>

<p>to move into new application domains, experiment with new methods and</p>

<p>so on, as people in machine learning do. So I think that</p>

<p>statisticians can benefit from the playful creativity and unorthodox</p>

<p>experimentation that one sees in some machine learning work, as well</p>

<p>as the algorithmic and programming expertise that is standard in</p>

<p>computer science.</p>

<p><strong>SS: What sorts of things is your group working on these days?</strong></p>

<p>I have fairly eclectic interests, so we are working on a range of</p>

<p>topics. A number of projects concern the interface between</p>

<p>computation and statistics. For instance, we have a recent pre-print</p>

<p>(with postdoc Sivaraman Balakrishnan and colleague Bin Yu) that tries</p>

<p>to address the gap between statistical and computational guarantees in</p>

<p>applications of the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm for latent</p>

<p>variable models. In theory, we know that the global minimizer of the</p>

<p>(nonconvex) likelihood has good properties, but the in practice, the</p>

<p>EM algorithm only returns local optima. How to resolve this gap</p>

<p>between existing theory and actual practice? In this paper, we show</p>

<p>that under pretty reasonable conditions-&ndash;that hold for various types</p>

<p>of latent variable models-&ndash;the EM fixed points are as good as the</p>

<p>global minima from the statistical perspective. This explains what is</p>

<p>observed a lot in practice, namely that when the EM algorithm is given</p>

<p>a reasonable initialization, it often returns a very good answer.</p>

<p>There are lots of other interesting questions at this</p>

<p>computation/statistics interface. For instance, a lot of modern data</p>

<p>sets (e.g., Netflix) are so large that they cannot be stored on a</p>

<p>single machine, but must be split up into separate pieces. Any</p>

<p>statistical task must then be carried out in a distributed way, with</p>

<p>each processor performing local operations on a subset of the data,</p>

<p>and then passing messages to other processors that summarize the</p>

<p>results of its local computations. This leads to a lot of fascinating</p>

<p>questions. What can be said about the statistical performance of such</p>

<p>distributed methods for estimation or inference? How many bits do the</p>

<p>machines need to exchange in order for the distributed performance to</p>

<p>match that of the centralized &ldquo;oracle method&rdquo; that has access to all</p>

<p>the data at once? We have addressed some of these questions in a</p>

<p>recent line of work (with student Yuchen Zhang, former student John</p>

<p>Duchi and colleague Micheel Jordan).</p>

<p>So my students and postdocs are keeping me busy, and in addition, I am</p>

<p>also busy writing a couple of books, one jointly with Trevor Hastie</p>

<p>and Rob Tibshirani at Stanford University on the Lasso and related</p>

<p>methods, and a second solo-authored effort, more theoretical in focus,</p>

<p>on high-dimensional and non-asymptotic statistics.</p>

<p><strong>SS: What role do you see statistics playing in the relationship</strong></p>

<p><strong>between Big Data and Privacy?</strong></p>

<p>Another very topical question: privacy considerations are certainly</p>

<p>becoming more and more relevant as the scale and richness of data</p>

<p>collection grows. Witness the recent controversies with the NSA, data</p>

<p>manipulation on social media sites, etc. I think that statistics</p>

<p>should have a lot to say about data and privacy. There has a long</p>

<p>line of statistical work on privacy, dating back at least to Warner&rsquo;s</p>

<p>work on survey sampling in the 1960s, but I anticipate seeing more of</p>

<p>it over the next years. Privacy constraints bring a lot of</p>

<p>interesting statistical questions-&ndash;how to design experiments, how to</p>

<p>perform inference, how should data be aggregated and what should be</p>

<p>released and so on-&ndash;and I think that statisticians should be at the</p>

<p>forefront of this discussion.</p>

<p>In fact, in some joint work with former student John Duchi and</p>

<p>colleague Michael Jordan, we have examined some tradeoffs between</p>

<p>privacy constraints and statistical utility. We adopt the framework</p>

<p>of local differential privacy that has been put forth in the computer</p>

<p>science community, and study how statistical utility (in the form of</p>

<p>estimation accuracy) varies as a function of the privacy level.</p>

<p>Obviously, preserving privacy means obscuring something, so that</p>

<p>estimation accuracy goes down, but what is the quantitative form of</p>

<p>this tradeoff? An interesting consequence of our analysis is that in</p>

<p>certain settings, it identifies optimal mechanisms for preserving a</p>

<p>certain level of privacy in data.</p>

<p><strong>What advice would you give young statisticians getting into the</strong></p>

<p><strong>discipline right now?</strong></p>

<p>It is certainly an exciting time to be getting into the discipline.</p>

<p>For undergraduates thinking of going to graduate school in statistics,</p>

<p>I would encourage them to build a strong background in basic</p>

<p>mathematics (linear algebra, analysis, probability theory and so on)</p>

<p>that are all important for a deep understanding of statistical methods</p>

<p>and theory. I would also suggest &ldquo;getting their hands dirty&rdquo;, that is</p>

<p>doing some applied work involving statistical modeling, data analysis</p>

<p>and so on. Even for a person who ultimately wants to do more</p>

<p>theoretical work, having some exposure to real-world problems is</p>

<p>essential. As part of this, I would suggest acquiring some knowledge</p>

<p>of algorithms, optimization, and so on, all of which are essential in</p>

<p>dealing with large, real-world data sets.</p>
