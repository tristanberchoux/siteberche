      <description>_Editor&amp;#8217;s Note: I recently posted about a paper in Nature that purported to predict the H-index. The authors contacted me to get my criticisms, then responded to those criticisms. They have requested the opportunity to respond publicly, and I think it is a totally reasonable request. Until there is a better comment generating mechanism at the journal level, this seems like as good a forum as any to discuss statistical papers.</description>

 Jeff Leek Rafael Irizarry Roger Peng  I&amp;#8217;ve only been using it for a day but I&amp;#8217;m pretty impressed by how much it picked up. My only problem so far is having to merge different versions of the same paper.</description>
