      <description>A recent article in the New York Times describes the backstory behind the decision to not revise the ozone national ambient air quality standard. This article highlights the reality of balancing the need to set air pollution regulation to protect public health and the desire to get re-elected. Not having ever served in politics (does being elected to the faculty senate count?) I can&amp;#8217;t comment on the political aspect. But I wanted to highlight some of the scientific evidence that goes into developing these standards.</description>
