      <description>Not really statistics, but this is an interesting article about how rational optimization by individual actors does not always lead to an optimal solutiohn. Related, ere is the coolest street sign I think I&amp;rsquo;ve ever seen, with a heatmap of traffic density to try to influence commuters. An interesting paper that talks about how clustering is only a really hard problem when there aren&amp;rsquo;t obvious clusters. I was a little disappointed in the paper, because it defines the &amp;ldquo;obviousness&amp;rdquo; of clusters only theoretically by a distance metric.</description>

      <description>Just got back from IBC 2012 in Kobe Japan. I was in an awesome session (organized by the inimitable Lieven Clement) with great talks by Matt McCall, Djork-Arne Clevert, Adetayo Kasim, and Willem Talloen. Willem&amp;#8217;s talk nicely tied in our work and how it plays into the pharmaceutical development process and the bigger theme of big data. On the way home through SFO I saw this hanging in the airport.</description>

      <description>A few weeks ago we learned that Warren Buffett is a big IBM fanÂ (a $10 billion fan, that is). Having heard that I went over to the IBM web site to see what they&amp;#8217;re doing these days. For starters, they&amp;#8217;re not selling computers anymore! At least not the kind that I would use. One of the big things they do now is &amp;#8220;Business Analytics and Optimization&amp;#8221; (i.e. statistics), which is one of the reasons they bought SPSS and then later Algorithmics.</description>
