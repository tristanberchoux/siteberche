      <description>With a colleague, I wrote a paper titled, &amp;ldquo;Empirical estimates suggest most published medical research is true&amp;rdquo; which we quietly posted to ArXiv a few days ago. I posted to the ArXiv in the interest of open science and because we didn&amp;rsquo;t want to delay the dissemination of our approach during the long review process. I didn&amp;rsquo;t email anyone about the paper or talk to anyone about it, except my friends here locally.</description>
