      <description>It seems like half of the battle in statistics is identifying an important/unsolved problem. In math, this is easy, they have a list. So why is it harder for statistics? Since I have to think up projects to work on for my research group, for classes I teach, and for exams we give, I have spent some time thinking about ways that research problems in statistics arise.
I borrowed a page out of Roger&amp;#8217;s book and made a little diagram to illustrate my ideas (actually I can&amp;#8217;t even claim credit, it was Roger&amp;#8217;s idea to make the diagram).</description>
