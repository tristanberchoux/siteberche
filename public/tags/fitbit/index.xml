      <description>I have a Fitbit. I got it because I wanted to collect some data about myself and I liked the simplicity of the set-up. I also asked around and Fitbit seemed like the most &amp;ldquo;open&amp;rdquo; platform for collecting one&amp;rsquo;s own data. You have to pay $50 for a premium account, but after that, they allow you to download your data.
Or do they?
I looked into the details, asked a buddy or two, and found out that you actually can&amp;rsquo;t get the really interesting minute-by-minute data even with a premium account.</description>

      <description>A little while ago I wrote a post on statistics projects ideas for students. In honor of the first Simply Statistics Coursera offering, Computing for Data Analysis, here is a new list of student projects for folks excited about trying out those new R programming skills. Again we have rated each project with my best guess difficulty and effort required. Happy computing!
Data Analysis
 Use city data to predict areas with the highest risk for parking tickets.</description>
