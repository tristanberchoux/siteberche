      <description>Like many statisticians, I was amped to see a statistics paper appear in Science. Given the impact that statistics has on the scientific community, it is a shame that more statistics papers don&amp;#8217;t appear in the glossy journals like Science or Nature. As I pointed out in the previous post, if the paper that introduced the p-value was cited every time this statistic was used, the paper would have over 3 million citations!</description>

      <description>Is the microarray dead? Jeremey Leipzig seems to think that statistical methods for microarrays should be. I&amp;#8217;m not convinced, the technology has finally matured to the point we can use it for personalized medicine and we abandon it for the next hot thing? Not to Andrew for the link. Data from 5 billion webpages available from the Common Crawl. Want to build your own search tool - or just find out whats on the web?</description>
