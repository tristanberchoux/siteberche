      <description>_Editor&amp;#8217;s Note: This is the first in a set of point-counterpoint posts related to the value of abstract thinking in graduate education thatÂ we teased a few days ago. Brian Caffo, recently installed Graduate Program Director at the best Biostat department in the country, has kindly agreed to lead off with the case for abstraction. We&amp;#8217;ll follow up later in the week with my counterpoint. In the meantime, there have already been a number of really interesting and insightful comments inspired by our teaser post that are well worth reading.</description>
