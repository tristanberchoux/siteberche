      <guid>/2012/12/19/rafa-interviewed-about-statistical-genomics/</guid>
      <description>He talks about the problems created by the speed of increase in data sizes in molecular biology, the way that genomics is hugely driven by data analysis/statistics, how Bioconductor is an example of bottom up science, Simply Statistics gets a shout out, how new data are going to lead to new modeling/statistical challenges, and gives an ode to boxplots. It&amp;rsquo;s worth watching the whole thing&amp;hellip;</description>
