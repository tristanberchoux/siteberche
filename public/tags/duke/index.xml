      <description>Biomedical Computation Review has a nice summary (in which I am quoted briefly) by Kristin Sainani about the many different types of errors in computational research, including the infamous Duke incident and some other recent examples. The reproducible research policy at _Biostatistics_ is described as an example for how the publication process might need to change to prevent errors from persisting (or occurring).</description>

      <description>For those of you that don&amp;#8217;t know about the saga involving genomic signatures, I highly recommend reading this very good summary published in The Economist. Baggerly and Coombes are two statisticians that can confidently say they have made an impact on clinical research and actually saved lives. A paper by this pair describing the details was published in the Annals of Applied Statistics as most of the Biology journals refused to publish their letters to the editor.</description>
