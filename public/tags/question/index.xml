      <description>Nate Silver, everyone&amp;#8217;s favorite statistician made good, just gave an interview where he said he thinks many journal articles should be blog posts. I have been thinking about this same issue for a while now, and I&amp;#8217;m not the only one. This is a really interesting post suggesting that although scientific journals once facilitated dissemination of ideas, they now impede the flow of information and make it more expensive.Â Two recent examples really drove this message home for me.</description>
