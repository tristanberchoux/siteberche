      <description>Harvard Business school is getting in on the fun, calling the data scientist the sexy profession for the 21st century. Although I am a little worried that by the time it gets into a Harvard Business document, the hype may be outstripping the real promise of the discipline. Still, good news for statisticians! (via Rafa via Francesca D.&amp;#8217;s Facebook feed).  The counterpoint is this article which suggests that data scientists might be able to be replaced by tools/software.</description>

      <description>Andrew Jaffe pointed me to prezi.com. It looks like a new way of making presentations. Andrew made an example here in just a couple of minutes. Here is one about Coca-Cola.
Things I like:  I go to a lot of Beamer/Powerpoint talks, these presentations at least look different and could be interesting.  It is cool how it is easy to arrange slides in a non-linear order and potentially avoid clicking forward a few slides then back a few slides I also like how the &amp;#8220;global picture&amp;#8221; of the talk can be shown in a display.</description>
