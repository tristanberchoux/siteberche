      <description>Okay, this is not really about pre-cog, but just a pointer to some data that might be of interest to people. A number of cities post their crime data online, ready for scraping and data analysis. For example, the Baltimore Sun has a Google map of homicides in the city of Baltimore. There&amp;#8217;s also some data for Oakland.
Looking at the map is fun, but not particularly useful from a data analysis standpoint.</description>

      <description>A cool article here on a group predicting the place/time when crime is going to happen. It looks like they are using a Poisson process. They liken it to predicting the after shocks of an earthquake. More details on the math behind the pre-cog software can be found here. I wonder what their prediction accuracy is? Thanks to Rafa for pointing the link out. </description>
