      <description>A fascinating article about the debate on whether to regulate sugary beverages. One of the protagonists is David Allison, a statistical geneticist, among other things. It is fascinating to see the interplay of statistical analysis and public policy. Yet another example of how statistics/data will drive some of the most important policy decisions going forward.  A related article is this one on the way risk is reported in the media.</description>

      <description>I have been seeing this paper all over Twitter/the blogosphere. It&amp;#8217;s a sexy idea: can you predict how &amp;#8220;high-impact&amp;#8221; a scientist will be in the future. It is also a pretty flawed data analysis&amp;#8230;so this weeks prediction contest is to identify why the statistics in this paper are so flawed. In my first pass read I noticed about 5 major flaws.
_Editor&amp;#8217;s note: I posted the criticisms and the authors respond here: http://disq.</description>

      <description>One incredibly popular tool for the analysis of high-dimensional data is the lasso. The lasso is commonly used in cases when you have many more predictors than independent samples (the n &amp;#171;&amp;#160;p) problem. It is also often used in the context of prediction.
Suppose you have an outcome Y and several predictors X1,&amp;#8230;,XM, the lasso fits a model:
Y = B + B1 X1 + B2 X2 + &amp;#8230; + BM XM + E</description>
