      <description>Amazon released it&amp;#8217;s new iPad competitor, the Kindle Fire, today. A quick read through the description shows it has some interesting features, including a custom-built web browser called Silk. One innovation that they claim is that the browser works in conjunction with Amazon&amp;#8217;s EC2 cloud computing platform to speed up the web-surfing experience by doing some computing on your end and some on their end. Seems cool, if it really does make things faster.</description>
