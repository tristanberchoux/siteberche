      <description>Welcome to my website and thank you for dropping by. I am a Research Fellow within Geography and Environmental Science at the University of Southampton. My principal research interests lie in the field of spatial planning and sustainable rural development. I am a postdoctoral research fellow in economic geography applied to rural territories. My current work looks at the impact of climate change on landscapes and livelihoods under different policy scenarios in the Mekong Delta using spatial modelling.</description>

      <description>QGIS Tutorial QGIS is a well-developed, open source GIS program, with a wide range of features and great compatability with numerous formats. Furthermore, basic installation includes linkages with other open source GIS tools such as GRASS GIS and SAGA (among others). It is one primary software packages that I use in research and teach in classes.
This tutorial is designed to familiarize GIS users with the general layout, features and tools of QGIS, through working with sample datasets that are provided.</description>

      <description>Editor&amp;rsquo;s note: For a while we ran an interview series for statisticians and data scientists, but things have gotten a little hectic around here so we&amp;rsquo;ve dropped the ball! But we are re-introducing the series, starting with Stephanie Hicks. If you have recommendations of a (junior) person in academics or industry you would like to see promoted, reach out to Jeff (@jtleek) on Twitter!
Stephanie Hicks received her PhD in statistics in 2013 at Rice University and has already made major contributions to the analysis of single cell sequencing data and the theory and practice of teaching data science.</description>

      <description>What makes for a good data scientist? This is a question I asked a long time ago and am still trying to figure out the answer. Seven years ago, I wrote:
 I was thinking about the people who I think are really good at data analysis and it occurred to me that they were all people I knew. So I started thinking about people that I don’t know (and there are many) but are equally good at data analysis.</description>

      <description>In episode 71 of Not So Standard Deviations, Hilary Parker and I inaugurated our first “Data Science Design Challenge” segment where we discussed how we would solve a given problem using data science. The idea with calling it a “design challenge” was to contrast it with common “hackathon” type models where you are presented with an already-collected dataset and then challenged to find something interesting in the data. Here, we wanted to start with a problem and then talk about how data might be collected and analyzed to address the problem.</description>

      <description>A recent article in the Wall Street Journal, &amp;ldquo;At Netflix, Who Wins When It’s Hollywood vs. the Algorithm?&amp;rdquo; by Shalini Ramachandran and Joe Flint details some of the internal debates within Netflix between the Los Angeles-based content team, which is in charge of developing and marketing new content for the streaming service, and the data team. The initial example described is an advertising image for a new show (“Grace and Frankie&amp;rdquo;&amp;ldquo;) starring Jane Fonda and Lily Tomlin.</description>

      <title>The Role of Theory in Data Analysis</title>

      <description>In data analysis, we make use of a lot of theory, whether we like to admit it or not. In a traditional statistical training, things like the central limit theorem and the law of large numbers (and their many variations) are deeply baked into our heads. I probably use the central limit theorem everyday in my work, sometimes for the better, and sometimes for the worse. Even if I’m not directly applying a Normal approximation, knowledge of the central limit theorem will often guide my thinking and help me to decide what to do in a given data analytic situation.</description>

      <description>I was recently asked to moderate an academic panel on the role of universities in training the data science workforce. I preceded each question with opinionated introductions which I have fused into this blog post. These are weakly held opinions so please consider commenting if you disagree with anything.
To discuss data science education we first need to clearly state what it means. The panel organizers defined data science as &amp;ldquo;an emerging discipline that draws upon knowledge in statistical methodology and computer science to create impactful predictions and insights for a wide range of traditional scholarly fields.</description>

      <description>Editor&amp;rsquo;s Note: I attended an ASA Chair&amp;rsquo;s meeting and spoke about ways we could support junior faculty in data science. After giving my talk Galin Jones, Professor and Director of Statistics at University of Minnesota, and I had an interesting conversation about how they had changed their promotion criteria in response to a faculty candidate being unique. I asked him to write about his experience and he kindly contributed the following post.</description>

      <description>tl;dr check out our new paper on the relationship between MOOC completion and economic outcomes!
Last Monday we launched our Chromebook Data Science Program so that anyone with an internet connection, a web browser, and the ability to read and follow instructions could become a data scientist.
Why did we launch another MOOC program? Aren&amp;rsquo;t MOOCs dead?
Well we didn&amp;rsquo;t think so :). We have been pretty excited about MOOCs for a while now and now run five different MOOC programs through the Johns Hopkins Data Science Lab.</description>

      <description>The Johns Hopkins Data Science Lab has been teaching massive online open courses for more than 5 years now. During that time we&amp;rsquo;ve reached more than 5 million learners who want to break into the number one rated job in America.
While we have been incredibly excited about the results of these training programs, we&amp;rsquo;ve also learned over the last 5+ years that there are still significant barriers to getting into data science.</description>

      <description>Rolando Acosta and I recently posted a manuscript on bioRxiv describing the effects of Hurricane María, based on an analysis of mortality data provided by the Demographic Registry. I was also an author on a paper published in May based on a survey of 3,000 households. These are very different datasets. Assuming it is complete, the Demographic Registry dataset provides much more precise quantitative information. However, this dataset was not made publicly available until June 1, 2018, three days after the paper based on the survey data was released.</description>

      <description>There are often discussions within the data science community about which tools are best for doing data science. The most recent iteration of this discussion is the so-called “First Notebook War”, which is well-summarized by Yihui Xie in his blog post (it is a great read).
One thing that I have found missing from many discussions about tooling in data analysis is an acknowledgment that data analysis tends to advance through different phases and that different tools can be more or less useful in each of those phases.</description>

      <description>Hilary Parker and I just released part 2 of our book club discussion of Nigel Cross’s book Design Thinking and it centers around a profile of designer Gordan Murray, who spent his career designing Formula One race cars. One of the aspects of his job as a designer is taking a &amp;ldquo;systems approach&amp;rdquo; to solving problems. Coupled with that approach is his role in balancing the various priorities of members of his team.</description>

      <description>This week Hilary Parker and I have started our &amp;ldquo;Book Club&amp;rdquo; on Not So Standard Deviations where we will be discussing Nigel Cross&amp;rsquo;s book Design Thinking: Understanding How Designers Think and Work. We will be talking about how the work of designers parallels the work of data scientists and how many of the principles developed in design port over so well to data analysis. While data visualization has always taken cues from design, I think much broader aspects of data analysis could benefit from the work studying design.</description>

      <description>One conversation I’ve had a few times revolves around the question, “What’s the difference between science and data science?” If I were to come up with a simple distinction, I might say that
 Science starts with a question; data science starts with the data.
 What makes data science so difficult is that it starts in the wrong place. As a result, a certain amount of extra work must be done to understand the context surrounding a dataset before we can do anything useful.</description>

      <description>Recently, Apple’s stock price rose to the point where the company’s market valuation was above $1 trillion, the first U.S. company to reach that benchmark. Subsequently, numerous articles were published describing Apple’s journey to this point and why it got there. Most people describe Apple as a technology company. They make technology products: iPhones, iPads, Macs, etc. These are all computing devices. But there is another way to think of Apple and what kind of company they are as well as how they became so successful.</description>

      <description>Jenny Bryan recently gave a wonderful talk at the Use R! 2018 meeting in Brisbane about “Code Smells and Feels” (I recommend you watch a video of that talk). Her talk covers various ways to detect when your code “smells” and how to fix those smells through refactoring. While there is quite a bit of literature on this with respect to other programming languages, it’s not well-covered with respect to R.</description>

      <description>One of the fundamental questions that we can ask in any data analysis is, &amp;ldquo;Why do things vary?&amp;rdquo; Although I think this is fundamental, I’ve found that it’s not explicitly asked as often as I might think. The problem with not asking this question is that it can often lead to a lot of pointless and time-consuming work. Taking a moment to ask yourself, “What do I know that can explain why this feature or variable varies?</description>

      <description>Abstract The intentional ambiguity of the R language, inherited from the S language, is one of its defining features. Is it an interactive system for data analysis or is it a sophisticated programming language for software developers? The ability of R to cater to users who do not see themselves as programmers, but then allow them to slide gradually into programming, is an enduring quality of the language and is what has allowed it to gain significance over time.</description>

      <description>I was listening to the podcast The West Wing Weekly recently and Episode 4.17 (“Red Haven’s on Fire”) featured former staff writer Lauren Schmidt Hissrich. In introducing her, the podcast co-hosts mentioned that Hissrich was a writer for the Netflix series Daredevil, based on the Marvel Comics character. She is also the showrunner for a new Netflix series called The Witcher, which is based on a book by Andrzej Sapkowski.</description>

      <description>Matthew Panzarino had an interesting article in TechCrunch on Apple’s process for rebuilding their Maps app. While most of the article describes the laborious process of data collection, one part jumped out at me, which was the team that Panzarino describes as the &amp;ldquo;Department of Details.&amp;rdquo; They are responsible for a number of odds and ends regarding how maps are presented, but they are particularly concerned with presenting maps to people around the world.</description>

      <description>I’ve often heard that there is a need for data analysts to be creative in their work. But why? Where and how exactly is that creativity exercised?
On one extreme, it could be thought that a data analyst should be easily replaced by a machine. For various types of data and for various types of questions, there should be a deterministic approach to analysis that does not change. Presumably, this could be coded up into a computer program and the data could be fed into the program every time, with a result presented at the end.</description>

      <description>When learning about data analysis in school, you don’t hear much about the role that resources&amp;mdash;time, money, and technology&amp;mdash;play in the development of analysis. This is a conversation that is often had “in the hallway” when talking to senior faculty or mentors. But the available resources do play a significant role in determining what can be done with a given question and dataset. It’s tempting to think that the situation is binary&amp;mdash;either you have sufficient resources to do the “right” analysis, or you simply don’t do the analysis.</description>

      <description>In my post about relationships in data analysis I got a little push back regarding whether human relationships would ever not be important in data analysis and whether that has anything to do with the &amp;ldquo;maturity&amp;rdquo; of the field. I believe human beings will always play a role in data analysis, but it’s possible that over time they will play different roles. I wanted to discuss in this post what I meant about &amp;ldquo;institutions&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;institutional knowledge&amp;rdquo; in the context of data analysis and when the specific person who does the analysis is critical to how the analysis is done.</description>

Also how can you hate this guy (don’t miss the wrist watch)?</description>

      <description>Late last Friday, the Puerto Rico Department of Health finally released monthly death count data for the time period following Hurricane Maria:
BREAKING: the Puerto Rico Health Department has buckled under pressure and released the number of deaths for each month, through May of 2018. In September 2017, when Hurricane Maria made landfall, there was a notable spike, followed by an even larger one in October. pic.twitter.com/3Irw1eUOTC — David Begnaud (@DavidBegnaud) June 1, 2018   The news came three days after the publication of our paper describing a survey conducted to better understand what happened after the hurricane.</description>

      <description>The success of a data analysis depends critically on the audience. But why? A lot has to do with whether the audience trusts the analysis as well as the person presenting the analysis. Almost al presentations are incomplete because for any analysis of reasonable size, some details must be omitted for the sake of clarity. A good presentation will have a structured narrative that will guide the presenter in choosing what should be included and what should be omitted.</description>

      <description>All data arise within a particular context and often as a result of a specific question being asked. That is all well and good until we attempt to use that same data to answer a different question within a different context. When you match an existing dataset with a new question, you have to ask if the original context in which the data were collected is compatible with the new question and the new context.</description>

My colleagues are really impressive, for example five of our faculty are part of the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative and we have faculty across a range of departments including Biostatistics, Computer Science, Biology, Biomedical Engineering, Human Genetics. A number of my colleagues are activitely looking for postdocs and in an effort to make the postdoc job market a little less opaque I&amp;rsquo;m listing this non-comprehensive list of opportunities I know about here.</description>

      <description>The sharing of data is one of the key principles of reproducible research (the other one being code sharing). Using the data and code a researcher has used to generate a finding, other researchers can reproduce those findings and examine the process that lead to them. Reproducibility is critical for transparency, so that others can verify the process, and for speeding up knowledge transfer. But recent events have gotten me thinking more about the data sharing aspect of reproducibility and whether it is tenable in the long run.</description>

      <description>Software has for while now played a weird an uncomfortable role in the academic statistics world. When I first started out (circa 2000), I think developing software was considered &amp;ldquo;nice&amp;rdquo;, but for the most part, was not considered valuable as an academic contribution in the statistical universe. People were generally happy to use the software and extol its virtues, but when it came to evaluating a person’s scholarship, software usually ranked somewhere near the bottom of the list, after papers, grants, and maybe even JSM contributed talks.</description>

      <description>I recently finished reading Steve Coll’s book Directorate S, which is a chronicle of the U.S. war in Afghanistan post 9-11. It’s a good book, and one line stuck out for me as I thought it had relevance for data analysis. In one chapter, Coll writes about Lieutenant Colonel John Loftis, who helped run a training program for U.S. military officials who were preparing to go serve in Afghanistan. In reference to Afghan society, he says, &amp;ldquo;Everything over there is about relationships.</description>

It was nevertheless a fun talk and I got to talk about space-related stuff. If you want to hear some discussion of the development of this talk, you can listen to Episode 53 of Not So Standard Deviations.</description>

      <description>Defining success in data analysis has eluded me for quite some time now. About two years ago I tried to explore this question in my Dean’s Lecture, but ultimately I think I missed the mark. In that talk I tried to identify standards (I called them &amp;ldquo;aesthetics&amp;rdquo;) by which we could universally evaluate the quality of a data analysis and tried to make an analogy with music theory. It was a fun talk, in part because I got to play the end of Charles Ives’ Second Symphony.</description>

      <description>The NIH is soliciting input for their Strategic Plan for Data Science. If you are interested, today, April 2, is the deadline. You can provide input here. Below is what I plan to submit.
Summary My main critique is that the report is somewhat vague. More specifics and concrete examples should be included.
My main concern is that the draft describes initiatives with the goal of improving the back end of data science (data storage, data management, and computing infrastructure) without realizing that to do this one needs to understand the needs of those working on the front end of data science (data exploration, quality assessment, interactive data analysis, and method development).</description>

A much discussed topic in stats education is that computing should play a more prominent role in the curriculum. I strongly agree, but I think the main improvement will come from bringing applications to the forefront and mimicking, as best as possible, the challenges applied statisticians face in real life.</description>

      <description>Note: This post was originally published as part of a collection of discussion pieces on David Donoho&amp;rsquo;s paper. The original paper and collection of discussions can be found at the JCGS web site.
Professor Donoho’s commentary comes at a perfect time, given that, according to his own chronology, we are just about due for another push to &amp;ldquo;widen the tent&amp;rdquo; of statistics to include a broader array of activities. Looking back at the efforts of people like Tukey, Cleveland, and Chambers to broaden the meaning of statistics, I would argue that to some extent their efforts have failed.</description>

But his latest video titled &amp;ldquo;How Do Machines Learn?&amp;rdquo; is highly relevant and I thought very well done. That said, although the animations of the robots were very cute and helped to tell the story, I found them a bit disconcerting in a way that I can&amp;rsquo;t quite explain.</description>

      <description>A quick followup to Rafa&amp;rsquo;s analysis of the death toll from Hurricane Maria, from Axios:
 Puerto Rican Governor Ricardo Rosselló ordered a recount Monday of every death on the island since Hurricane Maria made landfall on September 20, as evidence continues to show that the official death toll grossly undercuts the true number, reports the New York Times.
 There are at least two ways to do this. One way is inferential in nature, taking a look at what we might expect the mortality to be and looking at what was observed.</description>

      <description>Sometimes, when you’re recording a podcast, it’s actually difficult to listen. That’s because while you’re recording you’re monitoring the network lag, the sound levels, the show notes, and the outline. On some episodes I’m just barely hanging on by a thread.
While Hilary Parker and I were recording Episode 50 of Not So Standard Deviations we had a discussion about her experience doing A/B testing at Etsy and how one experiment, which involved showing customers their passwords as they typed them, resulted in an increase in the number of failed login attempts, which was not what they were expecting.</description>

Her post has aleady inspired important discussions among the faculty at Johns Hopkins Biostatistics and is an important contribution to making sure our field is welcoming for everyone.</description>

      <description>A recent preprint by Alexis R. Santos-Lozada and Jeffrey T. Howard concludes that
  The mortality burden may [be] higher than official counts, and may exceed the current official death toll by a factor of 10.
  The authors used monthly death records from the Puerto Rico Vital Statistics system from 2010 to 2016. Although data for 2017 was apparently not available, they extracted data from a statement made by Héctor Pesquera, the Secretary of Public Safety:</description>

I&amp;rsquo;ve had a lot of interactions with people lately who want to take advantage of machine learning/AI in their research or business. Despite the excitement around AI and the exciting results we see from sophisticated research teams almost daily - the actual extent and application of AI is much smaller.</description>

      <description>In my ongoing discussion in my mind about what makes for a good data analysis, one of the ideas that keeps coming back to me is this notion of being able to “reason about the data”. The idea here is that it’s important that a data analysis allow you to understand how the data, as opposed to other aspects of an analysis like assumptions or models, played a role in producing the outputs.</description>

The gist of Face ID is that it recognizes your face using a mathematical representation and then unlocks the phone when it can confirm that it is you. In its keynote presentation, Apple mentioned that it&amp;rsquo;s using machine learning to do this and even had developed its own custom chips to do the computations.</description>

      <description>I thought I&amp;rsquo;d write a brief description of how I edit podcasts using Logic Pro X because when I was first getting into podcasts, I didn&amp;rsquo;t find a lot of useful stuff out there. A lot of it was YouTube videos of advanced editing or very basic stuff. I don&amp;rsquo;t consider myself a sound expert in any way, but I wanted a good workflow that would produce decent quality stuff.</description>

      <description>I have been interested for a while now in how data scientists can better communicate data analysis activities to each other and to people outside the field. I believe that our current methods are inadequate because they have mostly been borrowed from other areas (notably, computer science). Many of those tools are useful, but they were not developed to communicate data analysis concepts specifically and often fall short. I talked about this problem in my Dean&amp;rsquo;s Lecture earlier this year and how the field of data science could benefit from developing its own theories, to simplify communication as other fields have done.</description>

      <description>In a deeply reported article, Casey Ross and Ike Swetlitz report that IBM&amp;rsquo;s Watson isn&amp;rsquo;t living up to its hype when it comes to cancer care:
 The interviews suggest that IBM, in its rush to bolster flagging revenue, unleashed a product without fully assessing the challenges of deploying it in hospitals globally. While it has emphatically marketed Watson for cancer care, IBM hasn’t published any scientific papers demonstrating how the technology affects physicians and patients.</description>

      <description>For a long time now&amp;mdash;actually ever since we started the blog&amp;mdash;I&amp;rsquo;ve wanted to do a series of deep dives into specific papers that I thought were great. Clearly, it&amp;rsquo;s taken a bit longer than I expected, but I figure better late than never. Actually, that&amp;rsquo;s become a bit of a theme for my work these days!
One problem I have with much academic writing on the Internet is that I feel like most of it is devoted to (1) promoting one&amp;rsquo;s own work; or (2) identifying weaknesses in others&amp;rsquo; work.</description>

      <description>About nine months ago I announced that I was attempting a Chromebook experiment for the 2nd time. At first I thought it was going to be a short term experiment just to see if it was possible to function with only a Chromebook. But in an interesting twist I got used to it and have been working exclusively on a Chromebook for the last few months since the experiment started.</description>

      <description>I recently coded up a simple package that implements a file-based queue abstract data type. This package was needed for a different package that I’m working on involving parallel processing (more on that in the near future). Actually, this othe package is a project that I started almost nine years ago but was never able to get off the ground. I tried to implement a queue interface in the filehash package but it never served the purpose that I needed.</description>

John Storey recently asked if the source code is publicly available. Because I am not that organized, and these ideas come about during last minute preparations, the code was spread across several unrelated files. John’s request motivated me to include the code in one post.</description>

      <description>A few years ago I helped write a paper where we proposed scraping p-values from the medical literature to try to estimate the science-wise false discovery rate. The paper generated a ton of interesting discussion and inspired other groups to start collecting p-values from the literature.
As I&amp;rsquo;ve mentioned before the p-value is the most popular statistic ever invented so there are a lot of published p-values out there.
The tidypvals package is an effort to find previous collections of published p-values, synthesize them, and tidy them into one analyzable data set.</description>

      <description>A little over a year ago I saw a request from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute for proposals focused on undergraduate teaching. I decided to apply for this grant since it combines all of the things I&amp;rsquo;m interested in: teaching, education research, biology, and data science. So I put together a proposal, got a couple of colleagues to write me letters of support, and sent it off.
I was optimistic about the proposal since we have a cool opportunity through our work in scalable education to hit a large student population and we have been spending a lot of time thinking about using this platform to create a &amp;ldquo;science of data science&amp;rdquo; platform (more about that soon!</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve previously written about how business (that are built by humans) can initially become successful by optimizing the user experience. That great user experience is what defines the value that their product provides. However, over time, companies have to find a way to provide value that is defined outside of the business-user relationship. The difficulty here is that this new definition of value is not within the control of the company&amp;ndash;it is defined by the community via laws.</description>

      <description>I dislike violin plots because they look like Christmas ornaments.
It’s a pet peeve but there is somewhat of a practical reason as well. To demonstrate I created a dataset called dat that contains an outcome value from 25 different groups.
One of the first steps I take when analyzing data is to look at the distribution of my data. If there are groups, I like to stratify and look at the distributions.</description>

      <description>A recent publication (pay-walled) by Boyle et al. introducing the concept of an omnigenic model has generated much discussion. It reminded me of a question I’ve had for a while about the way genetics data is analyzed. Before getting into this, I’ll briefly summarize the general issue.
With the completion of the human genome project, human geneticists saw much promise in the possibility of scanning the entire genome for the genes associated with a trait.</description>

It was a fun meeting and one of the questions that came up was what kind of infrastructure do we need to enable shared curricula, compatibility across schools, and not reinventing the wheel. My answer to this question was that we need lecture notes stored in plain text files (like rmarkdown files) and data stored in csv files with direct links.</description>

      <description>Tidy data at its heart is a set of three rules for organizing a data set:
Each variable forms a column. Each observation forms a row. Each type of observational unit forms a table.  This is an incredibly useful abstraction for thinking about organizing data sets for analysis. In particular any data set that can be conveniently rectangled to look like this fun diagram from Jenny Bryan

      <description>There is currently a debate about whether or not the Comey letter flipped the election. Nate Cohn makes a convincing argument that the letter had little to no effect. Some time ago I looked at this myself and came to a similar conclusion. If anything, it was the ACA price hike announcement that had the bigger effect.
To test out blogdown (thanks Yihui Xie!) I decided to write this post showing the code I used for the simple analysis I performed, hoping to get others to look at the data, point out mistakes, or show me a better way to do what I did.</description>

      <description>Yesterday the government of Puerto Rico asked for bankruptcy relief in federal court. Puerto Rico owes about \$70 billion to bondholders and about $50 billion in pension obligations. Before asking for protection the government offered to pay back some of the debt (50% according to some news reports) but bondholders refused. Bondholders will now fight in court to recover as much of what is owed as possible while the government and a federal oversight board will try to lower this amount.</description>

      <description>This is a short open letter to those that believe scientists have a “liberal bias” and question their objectivity. I suspect that for many conservatives, this Saturday’s March for Science served as confirmation of this fact. In this post I will try to convince you that this is not the case specifically by pointing out how scientists often annoy the left as much as the right.
First, let me emphasize that scientists are highly appreciative of members of Congress and past administrations that have supported Science funding though the DoD, NIH and NSF.</description>

Esta inversión le permite ofrecer salarios más altos, lo cual atrae a los mejores profesores, tener las mejores instalaciones para la investigación y enseñanza, y mantener el precio por crédito más bajo que las universidades privadas. Gracias a estas grandes ventajas, la UPR suele ser la primera opción del estudiantado puertorriqueño, en particular los dos recintos más grandes, Río Piedras (UPRRP) y Mayagüez.</description>

      <description>Data analysis workflows and recipes are commonly used in science. They are actually indispensable since reinventing the wheel for each project would result in a colossal waste of time. On the other hand, mindlessly applying a workflow can result in totally wrong conclusions if the required assumptions don&amp;rsquo;t hold. This is why successful data analysts rely heavily on interactive data analysis (IDA). I write today because I am somewhat concerned that the importance of IDA is not fully appreciated by many of the policy makers and thought leaders that will influence how we access and work with data in the future.</description>

      <description>I just saw a link to an interesting article by Finale Doshi-Velez and Been Kim titled &amp;ldquo;Towards A Rigorous Science of Interpretable Machine Learning&amp;rdquo;. From the abstract:
 Unfortunately, there is little consensus on what interpretability in machine learning is and how to evaluate it for benchmarking. Current interpretability evaluation typically falls into two categories. The first evaluates interpretability in the context of an application: if the system is useful in either a practical application or a simplified version of it, then it must be somehow interpretable.</description>

      <description>A nice post by Alex Smolyanskaya over the Stitch Fix blog about some of the unique challenges of model building in a time series context:
 Cross validation is the process of measuring a model’s predictive power by testing it on randomly selected data that was not used for training. However, autocorrelations in time series data mean that data points are not independent from each other across time, so holding out some data points from the training set doesn’t necessarily remove all their associated information.</description>

      <description>Reproducibility is the ability to take the code and data from a previous publication, rerun the code and get the same results. Replicability is the ability to rerun an experiment and get &amp;ldquo;consistent&amp;rdquo; results with the original study using new data. Results that are not reproducible are hard to verify and results that do not replicate in new studies are harder to trust. It is important that we aim for reproducibility and replicability in science.</description>

      <description>_Editor&amp;rsquo;s note: This is the fourth chapter of a book I&amp;rsquo;m working on called Demystifying Artificial Intelligence. I&amp;rsquo;ve also added a co-author, Divya Narayanan, a masters student here at Johns Hopkins! The goal of the book is to demystify what modern AI is and does for a general audience. So something to smooth the transition between AI fiction and highly mathematical descriptions of deep learning. We are developing the book over time - so if you buy the book on Leanpub know that there are only four chapters in there so far, but I&amp;rsquo;ll be adding more over the next few weeks and you get free updates.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve gotten a number of inquiries over the last 2 years about my podcasting setup and I&amp;rsquo;ve been meaning to write about it but&amp;hellip;.
But here it is! I actually wanted to write this because I felt like there actually wasn&amp;rsquo;t a ton of good information about this on the Internet that wasn&amp;rsquo;t for people who wanted to do it professionally but were rather more &amp;ldquo;casual&amp;rdquo; podcasters. So here&amp;rsquo;s what I&amp;rsquo;ve got.</description>

      <description>There&amp;rsquo;s an interesting article over at Bloomberg about how data scientists have struggled at some hedge funds:
 The firms have been loading up on data scientists and coders to deliver on the promise of quantitative investing and lift their ho-hum returns. But they are discovering that the marriage of old-school managers and data-driven quants can be rocky. Managers who have relied on gut calls resist ceding control to scientists and their trading signals.</description>

      <description>Over the past 10 years thinking and writing about reproducible research, I&amp;rsquo;ve come to the conclusion that much of the discussion is incomplete. While I think we as a scientific community have come a long way in changing people&amp;rsquo;s thinking about data and code and making them available to others, there are some key sticking points that keep coming up that are preventing further progress in the area.
When I used to write about reproducibility, I felt that the primary challenge/roadblock was a lack of tooling.</description>

 Fake news: Before and after the election in 2016, Facebook (or Facebook&amp;rsquo;s Trending News algorithm) was accused of promoting news stories that turned out to be completely false, promoted by dubious news sources in FYROM and elsewhere. Theranos: This diagnostic testing company promised to revolutionize the blood testing business and prevent disease for all by making blood testing simple and painless.</description>

      <description>Being a scientist can be pretty stressful for any number of reasons, from the peer review process, to getting funding, to getting blown up on the internet.
Like a lot of academics I suffer from a lot of stress related to my own high standards and the imposter syndrome that comes from not meeting them on a regular basis. I was just reading through the excellent material in Lorena Barba&amp;rsquo;s class on essential skills in reproducibility and came across this set of slides by Phillip Stark.</description>

      <description>Four years ago we posted on Nate Silver&amp;rsquo;s, and other forecasters&amp;rsquo;, triumph over pundits. In contrast, after yesterday&amp;rsquo;s presidential election, results contradicted most polls and data-driven forecasters, several news articles came out wondering how this happened. It is important to point out that not all forecasters got it wrong. Statistically speaking, Nate Silver, once again, got it right.
To show this, below I include a plot showing the expected margin of victory for Clinton versus the actual results for the most competitive states provided by 538.</description>

      <description>Josh Nussbaum has an interesting post over at Medium about whether massive datasets are the new server rooms of tech business.
The analogy comes from the &amp;ldquo;old days&amp;rdquo; where in order to start an Internet business, you had to buy racks and servers, rent server space, buy network bandwidth, license expensive server software, backups, and on and on. In order to do all that up front, it required a substantial amount of capital just to get off the ground.</description>

The first thing I thought was interesting was their explicit acknowledgement of the process I outlined in a previous post for building an AI startup - (1) convince (or in this case pay) some humans to be your training set, and (2) collect the data on the humans and then use it to build your AI.</description>

      <description>There&amp;rsquo;s a great story by Nate Cohn over at the New York Times&amp;rsquo; Upshot about the dangers of &amp;ldquo;weighting up&amp;rdquo; a sample from a survey. In this case, it is in regards to a U.S.C/LA Times poll asking who people will vote for President:
 The U.S.C./LAT poll weights for many tiny categories: like 18-to-21-year-old men, which U.S.C./LAT estimates make up around 3.3 percent of the adult citizen population. Weighting simply for 18-to-21-year-olds would be pretty bold for a political survey; 18-to-21-year-old men is really unusual.</description>

      <description>Sam Lessin at The Information has a nice post (sorry, paywall, but it&amp;rsquo;s a great publication) about how increased measurement and analysis is changing the nature of venture capital investing.
 This brings me back to what is happening at series A financings. Investors have always, obviously, tried to do diligence at all financing rounds. But series A investments used to be an exercise in a few top-level metrics a company might know, some industry interviews and analysis, and a whole lot of trust.</description>

      <description>As part of the Johns Hopkins Data Science Lab we are setting up a web and mobile data product prototyping shop. As part of that process I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on different types of very cheap and easy to prototype apps. A few days ago I posted about creating a distributed data collection app with Google Sheets.
So for fun I built another kind of app. This one I&amp;rsquo;m calling papr and its sort of like &amp;ldquo;Tinder for preprints&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <guid>/2016/09/29/statistical-vitriol/</guid>
      <description>Over the last few months there has been a lot of vitriol around statistical ideas. First there were data parasites and then there were methodological terrorists. These epithets came from established scientists who have relatively little statistical training. There was the predictable backlash to these folks from their counterparties, typically statisticians or statistically trained folks who care about open source.
I&amp;rsquo;m a statistician who cares about open source but I also frequently collaborate with scientists from different fields.</description>

      <description>Palantir, the secretive data science/consulting/software company, continues to be a mystery to most people, but recent reports have not been great. Reuters reports that the U.S. Department of Labor is suing it for employment discrimination:
 The lawsuit alleges Palantir routinely eliminated Asian applicants in the resume screening and telephone interview phases, even when they were as qualified as white applicants.
 Interestingly, the report indicates a statistical argument:
 In one example cited by the Labor Department, Palantir reviewed a pool of more than 130 qualified applicants for the role of engineering intern.</description>

      <description>Democratic elections permit us to vote for whomever we perceive has the highest expectation to do better with the issues we care about. Let&amp;rsquo;s simplify and assume we can quantify how satisfied we are with an elected official&amp;rsquo;s performance. Denote this quantity with X. Because when we cast our vote we still don&amp;rsquo;t know for sure how the candidate will perform, we base our decision on what we expect, denoted here with E(X).</description>

      <description>From the Wall Street Journal:
 Several weeks ago, Facebook disclosed in a post on its &amp;ldquo;Advertiser Help Center&amp;rdquo; that its metric for the average time users spent watching videos was artificially inflated because it was only factoring in video views of more than three seconds. The company said it was introducing a new metric to fix the problem.
 A classic case of left censoring (in this case, by &amp;ldquo;accident&amp;rdquo;).</description>

      <description>Today I&amp;rsquo;m happy to announce that we&amp;rsquo;re launching a new specialization on Coursera titled Mastering Software Development in R. This is a 5-course sequence developed with Sean Kross and Brooke Anderson.
This sequence differs from our previous Data Science Specialization because it focuses primarily on using R for developing software. We&amp;rsquo;ve found that as the field of data science evolves, it is becoming ever more clear that software development skills are essential for producing useful data science results and products.</description>

      <description>This summer I had several conversations with undergraduate students seeking career advice. All were interested in data analysis and were considering graduate school. I also frequently receive requests for advice via email. We have posted on this topic before, for example here and here, but I thought it would be useful to share this short guide I put together based on my recent interactions.
It&amp;rsquo;s OK to be confused When I was a college senior I didn&amp;rsquo;t really understand what Applied Statistics was nor did I understand what one does as a researcher in academia.</description>

      <description>Jenny Bryan, developer of the google sheets R package, gave a talk at Use2015 about the package.
One of the things that got me most excited about the package was an example she gave in her talk of using the Google Sheets package for data collection at ultimate frisbee tournaments. One reason is that I used to play a little ultimate back in the day.
Another is that her idea is an amazing one for producing cool public health applications.</description>

      <description>By now, you&amp;rsquo;ve probably heard of the replication crisis in science. In summary, many conclusions from experiments done in a variety of fields have been found to not hold water when followed up in subsequent experiments. There are now any number of famous examples now, particularly from the fields of psychology and clinical medicine that show that the rate of replication of findings is less than the the expected rate.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;Raw data&amp;rdquo; is one of those terms that everyone in statistics and data science uses but no one defines. For example, we all agree that we should be able to recreate results in scientific papers from the raw data and the code for that paper.
 But what do we mean when we say raw data?
 When working with collaborators or students I often find myself saying - could you just give me the raw data so I can do the normalization or processing myself.</description>

      <description>It Might All Be Wrong Tom Nichols and colleagues have published a paper on the software used to analyze fMRI data:
 Functional MRI (fMRI) is 25 years old, yet surprisingly its most common statistical methods have not been validated using real data. Here, we used resting-state fMRI data from 499 healthy controls to conduct 3 million task group analyses. Using this null data with different experimental designs, we estimate the incidence of significant results.</description>

 I like using R to learn interesting things about our data, but my longer term goal is to make it easy for any of our engineers to do so&amp;hellip;.Towards this goal, I’ve been focusing on building reliable tools and frameworks that people can apply to a variety of problems, rather than “one-off” analysis scripts.</description>

While many new things were announced, the one thing that caught my eye was the dramatic expansion of Apple&amp;rsquo;s use of artificial intelligence (AI) tools. I talked a bit about AI with Hilary Parker on the latest Not So Standard Deviations, particularly in the context of Amazon&amp;rsquo;s Echo/Alexa, and I think it&amp;rsquo;s definitely going to be an area of intense competition between the major tech companies.</description>

Defining success is a crucial part of managing a data science experiment. Of course, success is often context specific. However, some aspects of success are general enough to merit discussion. A list of hallmarks of success includes:</description>

      <description>There&amp;rsquo;s definitely a need to innovate and develop new treatments in the area of asthma, but it&amp;rsquo;s easy to underestimate the barriers to just doing what we already know, such as making sure that people are following existing, well-established guidelines on how to treat asthma. My colleague, Elizabeth Matsui, has written about the challenges in a study that we are collaborating on:
 Our group is currently conducting a study that includes implementation of national guidelines-based medical care for asthma, so that one process that we’ve had to get right is to prescribe an appropriate dose of medication and get it into the family’s hands.</description>

      <description>I think it&amp;rsquo;s fair to say that things for Theranos, the Silicon Valley blood testing company, are not looking up. From the Wall Street Journal (via The Verge):
 Theranos has voided two years of results from its Edison blood-testing machines, issuing tens of thousands of corrected reports to patients and doctors and raising the possibility that many health care decisions may have been made based on inaccurate data. The Wall Street Journal first reported the news, saying that many of the corrected tests have been run using traditional machinery.</description>

      <description>Editor&amp;rsquo;s note: This post is a chapter from the book Executive Data Science: A Guide to Training and Managing the Best Data Scientists, written by myself, Brian Caffo, and Jeff Leek.
Software is the generalization of a specific aspect of a data analysis. If specific parts of a data analysis require implementing or applying a number of procedures or tools together, software is the encompassing of all these tools into a specific module or procedure that can be repeatedly applied in a variety of settings.</description>

      <description>Just about 10 years ago, I wrote my first of many articles about the importance of reproducible research. Since that article, one of the points I&amp;rsquo;ve made is that the key issue to resolve was one of tools and infrastructure. At the time, many people were concerned that people would not want to share data and that we had to spend a lot of energy finding ways to either compel or incentivize them to do so.</description>

      <title>The Real Lesson for Data Science That is Demonstrated by Palantir&#39;s Struggles</title>

      <description>Buzzfeed recently published a long article on the struggles of the secretive data science company, Palantir.
 Over the last 13 months, at least three top-tier corporate clients have walked away, including Coca-Cola, American Express, and Nasdaq, according to internal documents. Palantir mines data to help companies make more money, but clients have balked at its high prices that can exceed $1 million per month, expressed doubts that its software can produce valuable insights over time, and even experienced difficult working relationships with Palantir’s young engineers.</description>

      <title>Time Series Analysis in Biomedical Science - What You Really Need to Know</title>

      <description>For a few years now I have given a guest lecture on time series analysis in our School&amp;rsquo;s Environmental Epidemiology course. The basic thrust of this lecture is that you should generally ignore what you read about time series modeling, either in papers or in books. The reason is because I find much of the time series literature is not particularly helpful when doing analyses in a biomedical or population health context, which is what I do almost all the time.</description>

      <description>This article in Inside Higher Ed discusses next steps for Georgia Tech&amp;rsquo;s ground-breaking low-cost CS degree based on MOOCs run by Udacity. With Sebastian Thrun stepping down as CEO at Udacity, it seems both Georgia Tech and Udacity might be moving into a new phase.
One fact that surprised me about the Georgia Tech program concerned the demographics:
 Once the first applications for the online program arrived, Georgia Tech was surprised by how the demographics differed from the applications to the face-to-face program.</description>

      <description>Annika Salzberg is currently a biology undergraduate at Haverford College majoring in biology. While in high-school here in Baltimore she developed and taught an R class to her classmates at the Park School. Her interest in R grew out of a project where she and her fellow students and teachers went to the Canadian sub-Arctic to collect data on permafrost depth and polar bears. When analyzing the data she learned R (with the help of a teacher) to be able to do the analyses, some of which she did on her laptop while out in the field.</description>

Writing - what should I do and why? Write using collaborative software to avoid version control issues.
On almost all modern scientific papers you will have co-authors. The traditional way of handling this was to create a single working document and pass it around.</description>

      <description>Lately, for a range of projects I have been working on I have needed to obtain data from previous publications. There is a growing list of data repositories where data is made available. General purpose data sharing sites include:
 The open science framework The Harvard Dataverse Figshare Datadryad  There are also a host of field-specific data sharing sites.One thing that I find a little frustrating about these sites is that they add a lot of bells and whistles.</description>

      <description>I just read Karl&amp;rsquo;s great post on what it means to be a data scientist. I can&amp;rsquo;t really add much to it, but reading it got me thinking about the Apollo 12 mission, the second moon landing.
This mission is actually famous because of its launch, where the Saturn V was struck by lightning and John Aaron (played wonderfully by Loren Dean in the movie Apollo 13), the flight controller in charge of environmental, electrical, and consumables (EECOM), had to make a decision about whether to abort the launch.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking a lot recently about the practice of data analysis in different settings and how the environment in which you work can affect the view you have on how things should be done. I&amp;rsquo;ve been working in academia for over 12 years now. I don&amp;rsquo;t have any industry data science experience, but long ago I worked as a software engineer at two companies. Obviously, my experience is biased on the academic side.</description>

      <title>New Feather Format for Data Frames</title>

      <description>This past Tuesday, Hadley Wickham and Wes McKinney announced a new binary file format specifically for storing data frames.
 One thing that struck us was that, while R’s data frames and Python’s pandas data frames utilize different internal memory representations, the semantics of their user data types are mostly the same. In both R and pandas, data frames contain lists of named, equal-length columns, which can be numeric, boolean, and date-and-time, categorical (factors), or string.</description>

We are pretty fired up to try some new things with the journal and to make sure that the most important advances in statistical methodology and application have a good home.
We started a blog for the journal and our first post is here: The future of Biostatistics. Thanks to Karl Broman and his famiy we also have the twitter handle @biostatistics.</description>

      <description>The current publication system works something like this:
Coupled review and publication  You write a paper You submit it to a journal It is peer reviewed privately The paper is accepted or rejected a. If rejected go back to step 2 and start over b. If accepted it will be published If published then people can read it  This system has several major disadvantages that bother scientists. It means all research appears on a lag (whatever the time in peer review is).</description>

      <description>Soon after my discussion with Hilary Parker and Jenny Bryan about spreadsheets on Not So Standard Deviations, Brooke Anderson forwarded me this article written by Steven Levy about the original granddaddy of spreadsheets, VisiCalc. Actually, the real article was written back in 1984 as so-called microcomputers were just getting their start. VisiCalc was originally written for the Apple II computer and notable competitors at the time included Lotus 1-2-3 and Microsoft Multiplan, all since defunct.</description>

      <description>During the discussion that followed the ggplot2 posts from David and I last week we started talking about tidy data and the man himself noted that matrices are often useful instead of &amp;ldquo;tidy data&amp;rdquo; and I mentioned there might be other data that are usefully &amp;ldquo;non tidy&amp;rdquo;. Here I will be using tidy/non-tidy according to Hadley&amp;rsquo;s definition. So tidy data have:
 One variable per column One observation per row Each type of observational unit forms a table  I push this approach in my guide to data sharing and in a lot of my personal work.</description>

      <description>Some of my colleagues think of me as super data-sciencey compared to other academic statisticians. But one place I lose tons of street cred in the data science community is when I talk about ggplot2. For the 3 data type people on the planet who still don&amp;rsquo;t know what that is, ggplot2 is an R package/phenomenon for data visualization. It was created by Hadley Wickham, who is (in my opinion) perhaps the most important statistician/data scientist on the planet.</description>

      <description>Update: I realize this may seem like I&amp;rsquo;m picking on people. I really don&amp;rsquo;t mean to, I have for sure made all of these mistakes and many more. I can give many examples, but the one I always remember is the time Rafa saved me from &amp;ldquo;I got a big one here&amp;rdquo; when I made a huge mistake as a first year assistant professor.
In any introductory statistics or data analysis class they might teach you the basics, how to load a data set, how to munge it, how to do t-tests, maybe how to write a report.</description>

      <description>This article by by George Johnson in the NYT describes a study by Kamen P. Simonov​​ and Daniel S. Himmelstein​ that examines the hypothesis that people living at higher altitudes experience lower rates of lung cancer than people living at lower altitudes.
 All of the usual caveats apply. Studies like this, which compare whole populations, can be used only to suggest possibilities to be explored in future research. But the hypothesis is not as crazy as it may sound.</description>

      <description>A couple of days ago one of the editors of the New England Journal of Medicine posted an editorial showing some moderate level of support for data sharing but also introducing the term &amp;ldquo;research parasite&amp;rdquo;:
 A second concern held by some is that a new class of research person will emerge — people who had nothing to do with the design and execution of the study but use another group’s data for their own ends, possibly stealing from the research productivity planned by the data gatherers, or even use the data to try to disprove what the original investigators had posited.</description>

      <description>Hilary and I were snowed in over the weekend, so we recorded Episode 8 of Not So Standard Deviations. In this episode, Hilary and I talk about how to get your foot in the door with data science, the New England Journal&amp;rsquo;s view on data sharing, Google&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Cohort Analysis&amp;rdquo;, and trying to predict a movie&amp;rsquo;s box office returns based on the movie&amp;rsquo;s script.

How fast is this #rstats code? x https://t.co/0SbijNxxVa  — David Robinson (@drob) January 20, 2016  What does this have to do with parallel computation? Briefly, the code generates 5,000 standard normal random variates, repeats this 5,000 times and stores them in a 5,000 x 5,000 matrix (`x&amp;rsquo;).</description>

 What advice would you give to high school students thinking about majoring in statistics?
It’s such a great field! Not only is the industry booming, but more importantly, the disciplines of statistics teaches you to think analytically, which I find helpful for just about every problem I run into.</description>

We also talk about Theranos and the pitfalls of diagnostic testing, Spotify&amp;rsquo;s Discover Weekly playlist generation algorithm (and the need for human product managers), and of course, a little Star Wars. Also, Hilary and I start a new segment where we each give some &amp;ldquo;free advertising&amp;rdquo; to something interesting that they think other people should know about.</description>

Just like the lists for 2013 and 2014 I am doing this off the top of my head. I have avoided talking about stuff I worked on or that people here at Hopkins are doing because this post is supposed to be about other people&amp;rsquo;s awesome stuff. I wrote this post because a blog often feels like a place to complain, but we started Simply Stats as a place to be pumped up about the stuff people were doing with data.</description>

      <description>Right now reproducibility, replicability, false positive rates, biases in methods, and other problems with science are the hot topic. As I mentioned in a previous post pointing out a flaw with a scientific study is way easier to do correctly than generating a new scientific study. Some folks have noticed that right now there is a huge market for papers pointing out how science is flawed. The combination of the relative ease of pointing out flaws and the huge payout for writing these papers is helping to generate the hype around the &amp;ldquo;reproducibility crisis&amp;rdquo;.</description>

One manifestation of this trend is that we rarely see US kids from disadvantaged backgrounds become tenure track faculty, especially in the STEM fields. In my experience, the ones that do make it, when asked how they overcame the suboptimal math education their school district provided, often respond &#34;I was tracked&#34;</description>

In this episode, Hilary and I open up the mailbag and go through some of the feedback we&amp;rsquo;ve gotten on the previous episodes. The rest of the time is spent talking about the importance of reproducibility in data analysis both in academic research and in industry settings.</description>

      <description>A substantial amount of scientific research is funded by investigator-initiated grants. A researcher has an idea, writes it up and sends a proposal to a funding agency. The agency then elicits help from a group of peers to evaluate competing proposals. Grants are awarded to the most highly ranked ideas. The percent awarded depends on how much funding gets allocated to these types of proposals. At the NIH, the largest funding agency of these types of grants, the success rate recently fell below 20% from a high above 35%.</description>

  The statistics profession is caught at a confusing moment: the activities which preoccupied it over centuries are now in the limelight, but those activities are claimed to be bright shiny new, and carried out by (although not actually invented by) upstarts and strangers.</description>

Jeff Liebman has written extensively about the use of randomized experiments in policy (see here for a recent interview).</description>

      <description>Policy changes can have substantial societal effects. For example, clean water and hygiene policies have saved millions, if not billions, of lives. But effects are not always positive. For example, prohibition, or the &amp;ldquo;noble experiment&amp;rdquo;, boosted organized crime, slowed economic growth and increased deaths caused by tainted liquor. Good intentions do not guarantee desirable outcomes.
The medical establishment is well aware of the danger of basing decisions on the good intentions of doctors or biomedical researchers.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve recently seen a bunch of press on this paper, which describes an experiment with developing a prediction market for scientific results. From FiveThirtyEight:
 Although replication is essential for verifying results, the current scientific culture does little to encourage it in most fields. That’s a problem because it means that misleading scientific results, like those from the “shades of gray” study, could be common in the scientific literature. Indeed, a 2005 study claimed that most published research findings are false.</description>

Kasper Hansen took a break from trolling me on Twitter to talk about how he trusts packages on Github less than packages that are on CRAN and particularly Bioconductor. A couple of points he makes that I think are very relevant. First, that having a package on CRAN/Bioconductor raises trust in that package:</description>

      <description>Theranos is a Silicon Valley diagnostic testing company that has been in the news recently. The story of Theranos has fascinated me because I think it represents a perfect collision of the tech startup culture and the health care culture and how combining them together can generate unique problems.
I talked with Elizabeth Matsui, a Professor of Pediatrics in the Division of Allergy and Immunology here at Johns Hopkins, to discuss Theranos, the realities of diagnostic testing, and the unique challenges that a health-tech startup faces with respect to doing good science and building products people want to buy.</description>

      <description>Replication and confirmation are indispensable concepts that help define scientific facts. However, the way in which we reach scientific consensus on a given finding is rather complex. Although some press releases try to convince us otherwise, rarely is one publication enough. In fact, most published results go unnoticed and no attempts to replicate them are made. These are not debunked either; they simply get discarded to the dustbin of history. The very few results that garner enough attention for others to spend time and energy on them are assessed by an ad-hoc process involving a community of peers.</description>

      <description>The Wall Street Journal has published a lengthy investigation into the diagnostic testing company Theranos.
 The company offers more than 240 tests, ranging from cholesterol to cancer. It claims its technology can work with just a finger prick. Investors have poured more than $400 million into Theranos, valuing it at $9 billion and her majority stake at more than half that. The 31-year-old Ms. Holmes’s bold talk and black turtlenecks draw comparisons to AppleInc.</description>

      <description>A little while back I had the pleasure of flying in a small Cessna with a friend and for the first time I got to see what happens in the cockpit with a real pilot. One thing I noticed was that basically you don&amp;rsquo;t lift a finger without going through some sort of check list. This starts before you even roll the airplane out of the hangar. It makes sense because flying is a pretty dangerous hobby and you want to prevent problems from occurring when you&amp;rsquo;re in the air.</description>

      <description>The &amp;ldquo;This is Statistics&amp;rdquo; campaign has a nice profile of Shannon Cebron, a data scientist working at the Baltimore-based Pegged Software.
 What advice would you give to someone thinking of a career in data science?
Take some advanced statistics courses if you want to see what it’s like to be a statistician or data scientist. By that point, you’ll be familiar with enough statistical methods to begin solving real-world problems and understanding the power of statistical science.</description>

      <description>Episode 2 of my podcast with Hilary Parker, Not So Standard Deviations, is out! In this episode, we talk about user testing for statistical methods, navigating the Hadleyverse, the crucial significance of rename(), and the secret reason for creating the podcast (hint: it rhymes with &amp;ldquo;bee&amp;rdquo;). Also, I erroneously claim that Bill Cleveland is way older than he actually is. Sorry Bill.

      <description>tl;dr: 77% of replication effects from the psychology replication study were in (or above) the 95% prediction interval based on the original effect size. This isn&#39;t perfect and suggests (a) there is still room for improvement, (b) the scientists who did the replication study are pretty awesome at replicating, (c) we need a better definition of replication that respects uncertainty but (d) the scientific sky isn&#39;t falling. We wrote this up in a paper on arxiv; the code is here.</description>

Apple Music launched 3 months ago and all new users are offered a 3-month free trial. Today, that free trial ends and the big question is how many people will start to pay for their subscription, as opposed to simply canceling it.</description>

Last semester we successfully](http://simplystatistics.org/2014/11/25/harvardx-biomedical-data-science-open-online-training-curriculum-launches-on-january-19/) of my Data Analysis course. To create the second version, the first was split into eight courses. Over 2,000 students successfully completed the first of these, but, as expected, the numbers were lower for the more advanced courses. We wanted to remove any structural problems keeping students from maximizing what they get from our courses, so we studied the assessment questions data, which included completion rate and time, and used the findings to make improvements.</description>

      <description>The book Data Analysis for the Life Sciences is now available on Leanpub.
Data analysis is now part of practically every research project in the life sciences. In this book we use data and computer code to teach the necessary statistical concepts and programming skills to become a data analyst. Following in the footsteps of Stat Labs, instead of showing theory first and then applying it to toy examples, we start with actual applications and describe the theory as it becomes necessary to solve specific challenges.</description>

      <description>The @jtleek guide to writing your first academic paper https://t.co/APLrEXAS46  &amp;mdash; Stephen Turner (@genetics_blog) September 17, 2015  I have written guides on reviewing papers, sharing data, and writing R packages. One thing I haven&amp;rsquo;t touched on until now has been writing papers. Certainly for me, and I think for a lot of students, the hardest transition in graduate school is between taking classes and doing research.
There are several hard parts to this transition including trying to find a problem, trying to find an advisor, and having a ton of unstructured time.</description>

The COPSS Award is one of the most prestigious in statistics, sometimes called the Nobel Prize in statistics. This year the award went to John Storey who also won the Mortimer Spiegelman award for his outstanding contribution to public health statistics. This interview is a particular pleasure since John was my Ph.D. advisor and has been a major role model and incredibly supportive mentor for me throughout my career.</description>

Based on recent initiatives, such as BD2k, it is clear that the NIH is also enthusiastic and very much interested in supporting data science. For those that don&amp;rsquo;t know, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) is the largest public funder of biomedical research in the world.</description>

      <description>If you haven&amp;rsquo;t already read the amazing piece by Christie Aschwanden on why Science isn&amp;rsquo;t Broken you should do so immediately. It does an amazing job of capturing the nuance of statistics as applied to real data sets and how that can be misconstrued as science being &amp;ldquo;broken&amp;rdquo; without falling for the easy &amp;ldquo;everything is wrong&amp;rdquo; meme.
One thing that caught my eye was how the piece highlighted a crowd-sourced data analysis of soccer red cards.</description>

      <description>Everyone knows now that you have to correct for multiple testing when you calculate many p-values otherwise this can happen:
 http://xkcd.com/882/  &amp;nbsp;
One of the most popular ways to correct for multiple testing is to estimate or control the false discovery rate. The false discovery rate attempts to quantify the fraction of made discoveries that are false. If we call all p-values less than some threshold t significant, then borrowing notation from this great introduction to false discovery rates</description>

      <description>Biologists make wide use of correlation as a measure of reproducibility. Specifically, they quantify reproducibility with the correlation between measurements obtained from replicated experiments. For example, the ENCODE data standards document states
 A typical R2 (Pearson) correlation of gene expression (RPKM) between two biological replicates, for RNAs that are detected in both samples using RPKM or read counts, should be between 0.92 to 0.98. Experiments with biological correlations that fall below 0.</description>

Over the years it has come up in many different forms, but they fundamentals are the same. Back in the day, there was Java, which was supposed to be the platform that ran on any computing device.</description>

      <description>Recently, I was listening in on the conversation of some colleagues who were discussing a bug in their R code. The bug was ultimately traced back to the well-known phenomenon that functions like &amp;lsquo;read.table()&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;read.csv()&amp;rsquo; in R convert columns that are detected to be character/strings to be factor variables. This lead to the spontaneous outcry from one colleague of
 Why does stringsAsFactors not default to FALSE????
 The argument &amp;lsquo;stringsAsFactors&amp;rsquo; is an argument to the &amp;lsquo;data.</description>

      <description>From Technical.ly Baltimore:
 A nondescript, 3,700-square-foot building on Johns Hopkins’ Bayview campus will house a new data storage and computing center for university researchers. The $30 million Maryland Advanced Research Computing Center (MARCC) will be available to faculty from JHU and the University of Maryland, College Park.
 The web site has a pretty cool time-lapse video of the construction of the computing center. There&amp;rsquo;s also a bit more detail at the JHU Hub site.</description>

Data are eating the world, but our collective ability to analyze data is going on a starvation diet.
 Everywhere you turn, data are being generated somehow. By the time you read this piece, you’ll probably have collected some data. (For example this piece has 2,072 words). You can’t avoid data—it’s coming from all directions.</description>

 Back then we knew so little about the business that any insight was groundbreaking; data infrastructure was fast, stable, and real-time (I was querying our production MySQL database); the company was so small that everyone was in the loop about every decision; and the data team (me) was aligned around a singular set of metrics and methodologies.
But five years and 43,000 percent growth later, things have gotten a bit more complicated.</description>

With rare exceptions, it has taken years if not decades to establish these discoveries. And even the exceptions stand on the shoulders of incremental contributions. The researchers that produce this knowledge go through a slow and painstaking process to reach these achievements.</description>

      <description>A few weeks ago I sat down with Len Epp over at Leanpub to talk about my recently published book R Programming for Data Science. So far, I&amp;rsquo;ve only published one book through Leanpub but I&amp;rsquo;m a huge fan. They&amp;rsquo;ve developed a system that is, in my opinion, perfect for academic publishing. The book&amp;rsquo;s written in Markdown and they compile it into PDF, ePub, and mobi formats automatically.

      <description>In my opinion, batch effects are the biggest challenge faced by genomics research, especially in precision medicine. As we point out in this review, they are everywhere among high-throughput experiments. But batch effects are not specific to genomics technology. In fact, in this 1972 paper (paywalled), WJ Youden describes batch effects in the context of measurements made by physicists. Check out this plot of astronomical unit speed of light estimates with an estimate of spread confidence intervals (red and green are same lab).</description>

      <description>There has been a lot of recent interest from scientific journals and from other folks in creating checklists for data science and data analysis. The idea is that the checklist will help prevent results that won&amp;rsquo;t reproduce or replicate from the literature. One analogy that I&amp;rsquo;m frequently hearing is the analogy with checklists for surgeons that can help reduce patient mortality.
The one major difference between checklists for surgeons and checklists I&amp;rsquo;m seeing for research purposes is the difference in credentialing between people allowed to perform surgery and people allowed to perform complex data analysis.</description>

      <description>In a 2005 OMICS paper, an analysis of human and mouse gene expression microarray measurements from several tissues led the authors to conclude that &amp;ldquo;any tissue is more similar to any other human tissue examined than to its corresponding mouse tissue&amp;rdquo;. Note that this was a rather surprising result given how similar tissues are between species. For example, both mice and humans see with their eyes, breathe with their lungs, pump blood with their hearts, etc&amp;hellip; Two follow-up papers (here and here) demonstrated that platform-specific technical variability was the cause of this apparent dissimilarity.</description>

      <description>There are a lot of analogies between startups and academic science labs. One thing that is definitely very different is the relative value of ideas in the startup world and in the academic world. For example, Paul Graham has said:
 Actually, startup ideas are not million dollar ideas, and here&amp;rsquo;s an experiment you can try to prove it: just try to sell one. Nothing evolves faster than markets. The fact that there&amp;rsquo;s no market for startup ideas suggests there&amp;rsquo;s no demand.</description>

The basic idea behind Mendelian Randomization is the following. In a simple, randomly mating population Mendel&amp;rsquo;s laws tell us that at any genomic locus (a measured spot in the genome) the allele (genetic material you got) you get is assigned at random.</description>

From the paper:
 Data analysis is taught through an apprenticeship model, and different disciplines develop their own analysis subcultures. Decisions are based on cultural conventions in specific communities rather than on empirical evidence.</description>

 Wide - a wide data set has a large number of measurements per observation, but fewer observations. This type of data set is typical in neuroimaging, genomics, and other biomedical applications. Tall - a tall data set has a large number of observations, but fewer measurements. This is the typical setting in a large clinical trial or in a basic social network analysis.</description>

In this four week course, co-taught with Vince Carey and Mike Love, we will introduce you to Bioconductor&amp;rsquo;s general infrastructure and then focus on two specific technologies: next generation sequencing and microarrays. The lectures and assessments will be annotated in case you want to focus only on one of these two technologies. Although if you plan to be a bioinformatician we recommend you learn both.</description>

      <description>My student Prasad Patil has a really nice paper that just came out in Bioinformatics (preprint in case paywalled). The paper is about a surprisingly tricky normalization issue with genomic signatures. Genomic signatures are basically statistical/machine learning functions applied to the measurements for a set of genes to predict how long patients will survive, or how they will respond to therapy. The issue is that usually when building and applying these signatures, people normalize across samples in the training and testing set.</description>

      <description>Hypothesis:
 If every method in every stats journal was implemented in a corresponding R package (easy), was required to have a companion document that was a tutorial on how to use the software (easy), included a reference to how to cite the paper if you used the software (easy) and the paper/tutorial was posted to the relevant message boards for the communities of interest (easy) that journal would see a dramatic bump in its impact factor.</description>

      <description>Data science has a ton of different definitions. For the purposes of this post I&amp;rsquo;m going to use the definition of data science we used when creating our Data Science program online. Data science is:
 Data science is the process of formulating a quantitative question that can be answered with data, collecting and cleaning the data, analyzing the data, and communicating the answer to the question to a relevant audience.</description>

      <description>Editor&amp;rsquo;s note: Today 3/14/15 at some point between 9:26:53 and 9:26:54 it was the most π day of them all. Below is a repost from last year.
Happy π day everybody!
I wanted to write some simple code (included below) to the test parallelization capabilities of my new cluster. So, in honor of π day, I decided to check for evidence that π is a normal number. A normal number is a real number whose infinite sequence of digits has the property that picking any given random m digit pattern is 10−m.</description>

There was pretty widespread support for the idea that prevention is the right way to approach reproducibility.     It turns out I was the last speaker of the whole conference.</description>

      <description>In In we will teach statistical techniques that are commonly used in the analysis of high-throughput data and their corresponding R implementations. In Week 1 we will explain inference in the context of high-throughput data and introduce the concept of error controlling procedures. We will describe the strengths and weakness of the Bonferroni correction, FDR and q-values. We will show how to implement these in cases in which thousands of tests are conducted, as is typically done with genomics data.</description>

      <description>Matrix algebra is the language of modern data analysis. We use it to develop and describe statistical and machine learning methods, and to code efficiently in languages such as R, matlab and python. Concepts such as principal component analysis (PCA) are best described with matrix algebra. It is particularly useful to describe linear models.
Linear models are everywhere in data analysis. ANOVA, linear regression, limma, edgeR, DEseq, most smoothing techniques, and batch correction methods such as SVA and Combat are based on linear models.</description>

      <description>Jeff and I just this week published a commentary in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences on our latest thinking on reproducible research and its ability to solve the reproducibility/replication &amp;ldquo;crisis&amp;rdquo; in science (there&amp;rsquo;s a version on arXiv too). In a nutshell, we believe reproducibility (making data and code available so that others can recompute your results) is an essential part of science, but it is not going to end the crisis of confidence in science.</description>

 Consternation about peer review The reason why post publication peer review doesn&amp;rsquo;t work Consternation about faculty evaluation Major problems at companies like Yahoo and Microsoft.  Roger and I were just talking about this problem in the context of evaluating the impact of software as a faculty member and Roger suggested the problem is that:</description>

Namely:
 Completion rates are high when segments are shorter You can learn something about statistics in a short amount of time (2 minutes to complete, many people got all questions right) People will consume educational material on tablets/smartphones more and more.</description>

      <description>Editor&amp;rsquo;s note: This idea is Brian&amp;rsquo;s idea and based on conversations with him and Roger, but I just executed it.
The length of academic courses has traditionally ranged between a few days for a short course to a few months for a semester-long course. Lectures are typically either 30 minutes or one hour. Term and lecture lengths have been dictated by tradition and the relative inconvenience of coordinating schedules of the instructors and students for shorter periods of time.</description>

There has been a lot of discussion of personalized medicine, individualized health, and precision medicine in the news and in the medical research community and President Obama just announced a brand new initiative in precision medicine . Despite this recent attention, it is clear that healthcare has always been personalized to some extent.</description>

      <description>Editor&amp;rsquo;s Note: This is a repost of a previous post on our blog from 2012. The repost is inspired by similar issues with statistical illiteracy that are coming up in allergy screening and pregnancy screening. 
I just was doing my morning reading of a few news sources and stumbled across this Huffington Post article talking about research correlating babies cries to autism. It suggests that the sound of a babies cries may predict their future risk for autism.</description>

I loved doing it so much that I&amp;rsquo;m doing it again for 2014. Like last year, I have surely missed awesome things people have done. If you know of some, you should make your own list or add it to the comments! The rules remain the same. I have avoided talking about stuff I worked on or that people here at Hopkins are doing because this post is supposed to be about other people&amp;rsquo;s awesome stuff.</description>

That being said, I&amp;rsquo;m not sure the regression line says what they think it does, particularly if you pay attention to the variance around the line (via Rafa). I am digging the simplicity of charted.co from the folks at Medium. But I worry about spurious correlations everywhere. I guess I should just let that ship sail. FiveThirtyEight does a run down of the beer mile.</description>

More attention appears to have been given to the title than the post itself. The coverage and comments on social media have demonstrated the need for scientific education on the topic of genetics and race. Here I will try to explain, in layman&amp;rsquo;s terms, why the interpretations I read in the main Puerto Rican paper is scientifically incorrect and somewhat concerning.</description>

      <description>_Editor&amp;rsquo;s note: This is a repost of our previous post about deterministic statistical machines. It is inspired by the recent announcement that the Automatic Statistician received funding from Google. In 2012 we also applied to Google for a small research award to study this same problem, but didn&amp;rsquo;t get it. In the interest of extreme openness like Titus Brown or Ethan White, here is our application we submitted to Google. I showed this to a friend who told me the reason we didn&amp;rsquo;t get it is because our proposal was missing two words: &amp;ldquo;artificial&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;intelligence&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>A few months ago the Pew Research Internet Project published a paper on social media and the ‘spiral of silence’. Their main finding is that people are less likely to discuss a controversial topic on social media than in person. Unlike others, I did not find this result surprising, perhaps because I think like a statistician.
Shares or retweets of published opinions on controversial political topics - religion, abortion rights, gender inequality, immigration, income inequality, race relations, the role of government, foreign policy, education, climate change - are ubiquitous in social media.</description>

      <description>As explained in an earlier post, one of the homework assignments of my CS109 class was to predict the results of the midterm election. We created a competition in which 49 students entered. The most interesting challenge was to provide intervals for the republican - democrat difference in each of the 35 senate races. Anybody missing more than 2 was eliminated. The average size of the intervals was the tie breaker.</description>

 The New Yorker hating on MOOCs, they mention all the usual stuff. Including the really poorly designed San Jose State experiment. I think this deserves a longer post, but this is definitely a case where people are looking at MOOCs on the wrong part of the hype curve. MOOCs won&amp;rsquo;t solve all possible education problems, but they are hugely helpful to many people and writing them off is a little silly (via Rafa).</description>

      <description>Despite Statistics being the most mature data related discipline, statisticians have not fared well in terms of being selected for funding or leadership positions in the new initiatives brought about by the increasing interest in data. Just to give one example (Jeff and Terry Speed give many more) the White House Big Data Partners Workshop had 19 members of which 0 were statisticians. The statistical community is clearly worried about this predicament and there is widespread consensus that we need to be better at marketing.</description>

      <description>I recently was contacted for an interview about the curse of dimensionality. During the course of the conversation, I realized how hard it is to explain the curse to a general audience. One of the best descriptions I could come up with was trying to describe sampling from a unit line, square, cube, etc. and taking samples with side length fixed. You would capture fewer and fewer points. As I was saying this, I realized it is a pretty bad way to explain the curse of dimensionality in words.</description>

A similar argument can be made to avoid losing faith in humanity after reading internet comments or anonymous tweets, one of the most depressing activities that I have voluntarily engaged in.</description>

The O in the middle turns into an X when the test fails. The rate of Xs is 1-Pr(B|A). We want to know the probability of having the disease if you tested positive: Pr(A|B). Many find it counterintuitive that this probability is much lower than 90%; this animated gif is meant to help.</description>

      <description>In the medical sciences, there is a discipline called &amp;ldquo;evidence based medicine&amp;rdquo;. The basic idea is to study the actual practice of medicine using experimental techniques. The reason is that while we may have good experimental evidence about specific medicines or practices, the global behavior and execution of medical practice may also matter. There have been some success stories from this approach and also backlash from physicians who don&amp;rsquo;t like to be told how to practice medicine.</description>

      <description>Consider the following question: Is there a reproducibility/replication crisis in epidemiology?
I think there are only two possible ways to answer that question:
 No, there is no replication crisis in epidemiology because no one ever believes the result of an epidemiological study unless it has been replicated a minimum of 1,000 times in every possible population. Yes, there is a replication crisis in epidemiology, and it started in 1854 when John Snow inferred, from observational data, that cholera was spread via contaminated water obtained from public pumps.</description>

When I was a student, my advisor, John Storey, made a list of papers for me to read on nights and weekends. That list was incredibly helpful for a couple of reasons.
 It got me caught up on the field of computational genomics   It was expertly curated, so it filtered a lot of papers I didn&#39;t need to read   It gave me my first set of ideas to try to pursue as I was reading the papers   I have often thought I should make a similar list for folks who may want to work wtih me (or who want to learn about statistial genomics).</description>

 Has anyone applied game theory to the issue of anonymous peer review in academia?  &amp;mdash; Mick Watson (@BioMickWatson) October 2, 2014  It reminded me that a few years ago I had a paper that went through the peer review wringer. It drove me completely bananas. One thing that drove me so crazy about the process was how long the referees waited before reviewing and how terrible the reviews were after that long wait.</description>

      <title>The Drake index for academics</title>

      <description>I think academic indices are pretty silly; maybe we should introduce so many academic indices that people can&amp;rsquo;t even remember which one is which. There are pretty serious flaws with both citation indices and social media indices that I think render them pretty meaningless in a lot of ways.
Regardless of these obvious flaws I want in the game. Instead of the K-index for academics I propose the Drake index. Drake has achieved both critical and popular success.</description>

      <description>Both the scientific community and the popular press are freaking out about reproducibility right now. I think they have good reason to, because even the US Congress is now investigating the transparency of science. It has been driven by the very public reproducibility disasters in genomics and economics.  There are three major components to a reproducible and replicable study from a computational perspective: (1) the raw data from the experiment must be available, (2) the statistical code and documentation to reproduce the analysis must be available and (3) a correct data analysis must be performed.</description>

      <description>I just got back from the World Economic Forum&amp;rsquo;s summer meeting in Tianjin, China and there was much talk of disruption and innovation there. Basically, if you weren&amp;rsquo;t disrupting, you were furniture. Perhaps not surprisingly, one topic area that was universally considered ripe for disruption was Education.
There are many ideas bandied about with respect to &amp;ldquo;disrupting&amp;rdquo; education and some are interesting to consider. MOOCs were the darlings of&amp;hellip;last year&amp;hellip;but they&amp;rsquo;re old news now.</description>

      <description>In this recent opinion piece, Hadley Wickham explains how data science goes beyond Statistics and that data science is not promoted in academia. He defines data science as follows:
 I think there are three main steps in a data science project: you collect data (and questions), analyze it (using visualization and models), then communicate the results.
 and makes the important point that
 Any real data analysis involves data manipulation (sometimes called wrangling or munging), visualization and modelling.</description>

      <description>There is a huge amount of interest in reproducible research and replication of results. Part of this is driven by some of the pretty major mistakes in reproducibility we have seen in economics and genomics. This has spurred discussion at a variety of levels including at the level of the United States Congress.
To solve this problem we need the appropriate infrastructure. I think developing infrastructure is a lot like playing the lottery, only if the lottery required a lot more work to buy a ticket.</description>

The first step is to get some idea of what has already been published from these organizations. So here is a brief review of the papers I know about where human subjects experiments have been conducted by companies.</description>

Many students have created quality content around the subjects we discuss, and many of these materials are so good we feel that they should be shared with all of our students. We also know there are tons of other great organizations creating material (looking at you Software Carpentry folks).</description>

      <description>I have an idea for an app. You input the title and authors of a preprint (maybe even the abstract). The app shows the title/authors/abstract to people who work in a similar area to you. You could estimate this based on papers they have published that have similar key words to start.
Then you swipe left if you think the paper is interesting and right if you think it isn&amp;rsquo;t. We could then aggregate the data on how many &amp;ldquo;likes&amp;rdquo; a paper gets as a measure of how &amp;ldquo;interesting&amp;rdquo; it is.</description>

      <description>Web companies are using A/B testing and experimentation regularly now to determine which features to push for advertising or improving user experience. A/B testing is a form of randomized controlled trial that was originally employed in psychology but first adopted on a massive scale in Biostatistics. Since then a large amount of work on trials and trial design has been performed in the Biostatistics community. Some of these ideas may be useful in the same context within web companies, probably a lot of them are already being used and I just haven&amp;rsquo;t seen published examples.</description>

      <description>Web companies have been doing human subjects research for a while now. Companies like Facebook and Google have employed statisticians for almost a decade (or more) and part of the culture they have introduced is the idea of randomized experiments to identify ideas that work and that don&amp;rsquo;t. They have figured out that experimentation and statistical analysis often beat out the opinion of the highest paid person at the company for identifying features that &amp;ldquo;work&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been introducing people to R for quite a long time now and I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing some reflecting today on how that process has changed quite a bit over time. I first started using R around 1998&amp;ndash;1999 I think I first started talking about R informally to my fellow classmates (and some faculty) back when I was in graduate school at UCLA. There, the department was officially using Lisp-Stat (which I loved) and only later converted its courses over to R.</description>

      <description>I think that the main distinction between academic statisticians and those calling themselves data scientists is that the latter are very much willing to invest most of their time and energy into solving specific problems by analyzing specific data sets. In contrast, most academic statisticians strive to develop methods that can be very generally applied across problems and data types. There is a reason for this of course: historically statisticians have had enormous influence by developing general theory/methods/concepts such as the p-value, maximum likelihood estimation, and linear regression.</description>

Among his many accomplishments, he founded the Department of Statistics at UCLA (my alma mater), which is currently thriving. On the occasion of the Department&amp;rsquo;s 10th birthday, there was a small celebration, and I recall Don Ylvisaker mentioning that the reason they invited Jan to UCLA way back when was because he &amp;ldquo;knew everyone and knew everything&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>Thomas Piketty&amp;rsquo;s book Capital in the 21st Century was a surprise best seller and the subject of intense scrutiny. A few weeks ago the Financial Times claimed that the analysis was riddled with errors, leading to a firestorm of discussion. A few days ago the London School of economics posted a similar call to make the data open and machine readable saying.
 None of this data is explicitly open for everyone to reuse, clearly licenced and in machine-readable formats.</description>

 Dassault Systèmes is focusing on that level of granularity now, trying to simulate propagation of cholesterol in human cells and building oncological cell models. &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s data science and modeling,&amp;rdquo; Charlès told me. &amp;ldquo;Coupling the two creates a new environment in medicine.&amp;rdquo;

      <description>Academic publishing has always been a slow process. Typically you would submit a paper for publication and then wait a few months to more than a year (statistics journals can be slow!) for a review. Then you&amp;rsquo;d revise the paper in a process that would take another couple of months, resubmit it and potentially wait another few months while this second set of reviews came back.
Lately statistics and statistical genomics have been doing more of what math does and posting papers to the arxiv or to biorxiv.</description>

      <description>Reproducible research has been on my mind a bit these days, partly because it has been in the news with the Piketty stuff, and also perhaps because I just published a book on it and I&amp;rsquo;m teaching a class on it as we speak (as well as next month and the month after&amp;hellip;).
However, as I watch and read many discussions over the role of reproducibility in science, I often feel that many people miss the point.</description>

      <description>The latest crisis in data analysis comes to us (once again) from the field of Economics. Thomas Piketty, a French economist recently published a book titled Capital in the 21st Century that has been a best-seller. I have not read the book, but based on media reports, it appears to make the claim that inequality has increased in recent years and will likely increase into the future. The book argues that this increase in inequality is driven by capitalism’s tendency to reward capital more than labor.</description>

      <description>In the past couple of years several non-statisticians have asked me &amp;ldquo;what is Big Data exactly?&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;How big is Big Data?&amp;rdquo;. My answer has been &amp;ldquo;I think Big Data is much more about &amp;ldquo;data&amp;rdquo; than &amp;ldquo;big&amp;rdquo;. I explain below.
       Since 2011 Big Data has been all over the news. The New York Times, The Economist, Science, Nature, etc.. have told us that the Big Data Revolution is upon us (see google trends figure above).</description>

      <description>In my previous post I pointed out a major problem with big data is that applied statistics have been left out. But many cool ideas in applied statistics are really relevant for big data analysis. So I thought I&amp;rsquo;d try to answer the second question in my previous post: &amp;ldquo;When thinking about the big data era, what are some statistical ideas we&amp;rsquo;ve already figured out?&amp;rdquo; Because the internet loves top 10 lists I came up with 10, but there are more if people find this interesting.</description>

      <description>This year the idea that statistics is important for big data has exploded into the popular media. Here are a few examples, starting with the Lazer et. al paper in Science that got the ball rolling on this idea.
 The parable of Google Flu: traps in big data analysis Big data are we making a big mistake? Google Flu Trends: the limits of big data Eight (No, Nine!) Problems with Big Data  All of these articles warn about issues that statisticians have been thinking about for a very long time: sampling populations, confounders, multiple testing, bias, and overfitting.</description>

 Exploratory Data Analysis Reproducible Research Statistical Inference  I&amp;rsquo;m particularly excited about Reproducible Research, not just because I&amp;rsquo;m teaching it, but because I think it&amp;rsquo;s essentially the first of its kind being offered in a massive open format. Given the rich discussions about reproducibility that have occurred over the past few years, I&amp;rsquo;m happy to finally be able to offer this course for free to a large audience.</description>

      <description>I&#39;ve spent a considerable amount of time setting up filters to avoid getting spam from fake journals and conferences. Unfortunately, they are exceptionally good at thwarting my defenses. This does not annoy me as much as I pretend because, secretly, I enjoy reading some of these emails. Here are three of my favorites. 1) Over-the-top robot:  It gives us immense pleasure to invite you and your research allies to submit a manuscript for the journal “REDACTED”.</description>

      <description>One of the things that was hardest for me in graduate school was starting to think about my own research projects and not just the ideas my advisor fed me. I remember that it was stressful because I didn&amp;rsquo;t quite know where to start. After having done this for a while and particularly after having read a bunch of papers by people who are way more successful than I am, I have come to the following algorithm as a means for finding a topic that will have real world impact and also give you skills to take on new problems in a flexible way.</description>

      <description>The New York Times recently published an article on education titled &amp;ldquo;Parental Involvement Is Overrated&amp;rdquo;. Most research in this area supports the opposite view, but the authors claim that &amp;ldquo;evidence from our research suggests otherwise&amp;rdquo;. Before you stop helping your children understand long division or correcting their grammar, you should learn about one of the most basic statistical concepts: correlation does not imply causation. The first two chapters of this very popular text book describes the problem and even Khan Academy has a class on it.</description>

Last week, I took a break from my normal PhD student schedule to participate in a hackathon in San Francisco. The two-day event was hosted by rOpenSci, an organization committed to developing R tools for open science. Working with several wonderful people from the R community was inspiring, humbling, and incredibly fun.</description>

      <description>Every once in a while we see computational papers published in science journals with high impact factors. Genomics related methods appear quite often in these journals. Several of my junior colleagues express frustration that all their papers get rejected from these journals. I tell them that the same is true for most of my papers and remind them of these examples:

      <description>Environmental regulation in the United States has protected human health for over 40 years. Since the Clean Air Act was enacted in 1970, levels of outdoor air pollution have dropped dramatically, changing the landscape of once heavily-polluted cities like Los Angeles and Pittsburgh. A 2011 cost-benefit analysis conducted by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency estimated that the 1990 amendments to the CAA prevented 160,000 deaths and 13 million lost work days in the year 2010 alone.</description>

      <description>Mike Love (@mikelove) and I have been working hard the past couple of months preparing a free online edX course on data analysis for genomics. Our target audience are the postdocs, graduate students and research scientists that are tasked with analyzing genomics data, but don&amp;rsquo;t have any formal training. The eight week course will start with the very basics, but will ramp up rather quickly and end with real-life workflows for genome variation, RNA-seq, DNA methylation, and ChIP-seq.</description>

      <description>We did a really brief comparison of a few notable data science
programs for a grant submission we were working on. I thought it was pretty fascinating, so I&amp;rsquo;m posting it here. A couple of notes about the table.
 Our program can be taken for free, which includes assessments. If you want the official certificate and to take the capstone you pay the above costs.
 Udacity&amp;rsquo;s program can also be taken for free, but if you want the official certificate, assessments, or tutoring you pay the above costs.</description>

      <description>Paul Krugman recently joined the new FiveThirtyEight hating bandwagon. I am not crazy about the new website either (although I&amp;rsquo;ll wait more than one weeks before judging) but in a recent post Krugman creates a false dichotomy that is important to correct. Krugmanam states that &amp;ldquo;[w]hat [Nate Silver] seems to have concluded is that there are no experts anywhere, that a smart data analyst can and should ignore all that.&amp;rdquo; I don&amp;rsquo;t think that is what Nate Silver, nor any other smart data scientist or applied statistician has concluded.</description>

      <description>Developing statistical methods is hard and often frustrating work. One of the under appreciated rules in statistical methods development is what I call the 80&amp;frasl;20 rule (maybe could even by the 90&amp;frasl;10 rule). The basic idea is that the first reasonable thing you can do to a set of data often is 80% of the way to the optimal solution. Everything after that is working on getting the last 20%. (_Edit: Rafa points out that once again I&amp;rsquo;ve reverse-scooped a bunch of people and this is already a thing that has been pointed out many times.</description>

      <description>Happy π day everybody!
I wanted to write some simple code (included below) to the test parallelization capabilities of my new cluster. So, in honor of π day, I decided to check for evidence that π is a normal number. A normal number is a real number whose infinite sequence of digits has the property that picking any given random m digit pattern is 10−m. For example, using the Poisson approximation, we can predict that the pattern &amp;ldquo;123456789&amp;rdquo; should show up between 0 and 3 times in the first billion digits of π (it actually shows up twice starting, at the 523,551,502-th and 773,349,079-th decimal places).</description>

      <description>An astute reader (Niels Hansen, who is visiting our department today) caught a bug in my code on Github for the Leekasso. I had:
lm1 = lm(y ~ leekX)
predict.lm(lm1,as.data.frame(leekX2))
Unfortunately, this meant that I was getting predictions for the training set on the test set. Since I set up the test/training sets the same, this meant that I was actually getting training set error rates for the Leekasso. Neils Hansen noticed the bug and reran the fixed code with this term instead:</description>

      <description>Below is a plot of per capita GPD (in log scale) against years since women received the right to vote for 42 countries. Is this cause, effect, both or neither? We all know correlation does not imply causation, but I see many (non statistical) arguments to support both cause and effect here. Happy International Women&amp;rsquo;s Day ! 
The data is from here and here. I removed countries where women have had the right to vote for less than 20 years.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been closely following the fallout from PLoS One&amp;rsquo;s new policy for data sharing. The policy says, basically, that if you publish a paper, all data and code to go with that paper should be made publicly available at the time of publishing and include an explicit data sharing policy in the paper they submit.
I think the reproducibility debate is over. Data should be made available when papers are published.</description>

No one will publish it.” Sci. pubs are broken.  — Joshua Shaevitz (@shaevitz) February 13, 2014  On this blog, we&amp;rsquo;ve talked quite a bit about the publishing system, including in this interview with Michael Eisen.</description>

      <description>When Jeff, Brian, and I started the Johns Hopkins Data Science Specialization we decided early on to organize the program around using R. Why? Because we love R, we use it everyday, and it has an incredible community of developers and users. The R community has created an ecosystem of packages and tools that lets R continue to be relevant and useful for real problems.
We created a short video to talk about one of the reasons we love R so much.</description>

      <description>Editor&amp;rsquo;s Note: Ronald This is a repost of the post &amp;ldquo;R.A. Fisher is the most influential scientist ever&amp;rdquo; with a picture of my pilgrimage to his gravesite in Adelaide, Australia. 
You can now see profiles of famous scientists on Google Scholar citations. Here are links to a few of them (via Ben L.). Von Neumann, Einstein, Newton, Feynman
But their impact on science pales in comparison (with the possible exception of Newton) to the impact of one statistician: R.</description>

      <description>Executive Summary
 The problem is not p-values it is a fundamental shortage of data analytic skill. In general it makes sense to reduce researcher degrees of freedom for non-experts, but any choice of statistic, when used by many untrained people, will be flawed. The long term solution is to require training in both statistics and data analysis for anyone who uses data but particularly journal editors, reviewers, and scientists in molecular biology, medicine, physics, economics, and astronomy.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m going to try Monday&amp;rsquo;s for the links. Let me know what you think.
 The Guardian is reading our blog. A week after Rafa posts that everyone should learn to code for career preparedness, the Guardian gets on the bandwagon. Nature Methods published a paper on a webtool for creating boxplots (via Simina B.). The nerdrage rivaled the quilt plot. I&amp;rsquo;m not opposed to papers like this being published, in fact it is an important part of making sure we don&amp;rsquo;t miss out on the good software when it comes.</description>

      <description>Today I was thinking about reviewing, probably because I was handling a couple of papers as AE and doing tasks associated with reviewing several other papers. I know that this is idle thinking, but suppose peer review was just a drop down ranking with these 6 questions.
 How close is this paper to your area of expertise? Does the paper appear to be technically right? Does the paper use appropriate statistics/computing?</description>

      <description>Collaborations between biologists and statisticians are very common in genomics. For the data analysis to be fruitful, the statistician needs to understand what samples are being analyzed. For the analysis report to make sense to the biologist, it needs to be properly annotated with information such as gene names, genomic location, etc&amp;hellip; In a recent post, Jeff laid out his guidefor such collaborations, here I describe an approach that has helped me in mine.</description>

      <description>In his book Average Is Over, Tyler Cowen predicts that as automatization becomes more common, modern economies will eventually be composed of two groups: 1) a highly educated minority involved in the production of automated services and 2) a vast majority earning very little but enough to consume some of the low-priced products created by group 1. Not everybody will agree with this view, but we can&amp;rsquo;t ignore the fact that automatization has already eliminated many middle class jobs in, for example, manufacturing and the automotive industries.</description>

He is working with us to develop the Data Science Specialization as well as software for interactive learning of R and statistics.
Official swirl website: swirlstats.com
On September 27, 2013, I wrote a guest blog post on Simply Statistics to announce the creation of Statistics with Interactive R Learning (swirl), an R package for teaching and learning statistics and R simultaneously and interactively.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;There are sadistic scientists who hurry to hunt down error instead of establishing the truth.&amp;rdquo; -Marie Curie (http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Marie_Curie)
 Thanks to Kasper H. for that quote. I think it is a perfect fit for today&amp;rsquo;s culture of academic put down as academic contribution. One perfect example is the explosion of hate against the quilt plot. A quilt plot is a heatmap with several parameters selected in advance; that&amp;rsquo;s it. This simplification of R&amp;rsquo;s heatmap function appeared in the journal PLoS One.</description>

      <description>Tesla is hiring a data scientist. That is all. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure I buy the idea that Python is taking over for R among people who actually do regular data science. I think it is still context dependent. A huge fraction of genomics happens in R and there is a steady stream of new packages that allow R users to push farther and farther back into the processing pipeline. On the other hand, I think language diversity is clearly a plus for someone who works with data.</description>

      <description>This article, published last week, explained how &amp;ldquo;some younger users of Facebook say that using the site often leaves them feeling sad, lonely and inadequate&amp;rdquo;. Being a statistician gives you an advantage here because we know that naive estimates from missing not at random (MNAR) data can be very biased. The posts you see on Facebook are not a random sample from your friends&amp;rsquo; lives. We see pictures of their vacations, abnormally flattering pictures of themselves, reports on their major achievements, etc&amp;hellip; but no view of the mundane typical daily occurrences.</description>

Here are a few of the comments with my responses. I&amp;rsquo;m going to keep them brief because I think the edge.org crowd pushes people to say outrageous things, so it isn&amp;rsquo;t even clear they mean what they say.
I think the whole conceit of the question is a little silly.</description>

      <description>Well it technically is Monday, but I never went to sleep so that still counts as Sunday right?
 As a person who has taught a couple of MOOCs I&amp;rsquo;m used to getting some pushback from people who don&amp;rsquo;t like the whole concept. But I&amp;rsquo;m still happy that I&amp;rsquo;m not the only one who thinks they are a pretty good idea and still worth doing. I think that both the hype and the backlash are too much.</description>

      <description>After reposting on the comparison between the lasso and the always top 10 predictor (leekasso) I got some feedback that the problem could be I wasn&amp;rsquo;t debiasing the Lasso (thanks Tim T. on Twitter!). The idea behind debiasing (as I understand it) is to use the Lasso to do feature selection and then fit model without shrinkage to &amp;ldquo;debias&amp;rdquo; the coefficients. The debiased model is then used for prediction. Noah Simon, who knows approximately infinitely more about this than I do, kindly provided some code for fitting a debiased Lasso.</description>

      <description>Editor&amp;rsquo;s note: This is a previously published post of mine from a couple of years ago (!). I always thought about turning it into a paper. The interesting idea (I think) is how the causal model matters for whether the lasso or the marginal regression approach works better. Also check it out, the Leekasso is part of the SuperLearner package.
One incredibly popular tool for the analysis of high-dimensional data is the lasso.</description>

The basic problem is that the way air pollution is regulated, the EPA and state and local agencies monitor the air pollution in each state. When the levels of pollution are above the national ambient air quality standards at the monitors in that state, the state is considered in &amp;ldquo;non-attainment&amp;rdquo; (i.</description>

      <description>There is a lot of noise around the &amp;ldquo;R versus Contender X&amp;rdquo; for Data Science. I think the two main competitors right now that I hear about are Python and Julia. I&amp;rsquo;m not going to weigh into the debates because I go by the motto: &amp;ldquo;Why not just use something that works?&amp;rdquo;
R offers a lot of benefits if you are interested in statistical or predictive modeling. It is basically unrivaled in terms of the breadth of packages for applied statistics.</description>

I have also avoided talking about stuff I worked on or that people here at Hopkins are doing because this post is supposed to be about other people&amp;rsquo;s awesome stuff.

      <description>One of the hottest topics in science has two main conclusions:
 Most published research is false There is a reproducibility crisis in science  The first claim is often stated in a slightly different way: that most results of scientific experiments do not replicate. I recently got caught up in this debate and I frequently get asked about it.
So I thought I&amp;rsquo;d do a very brief review of the reported evidence for the two perceived crises.</description>

      <description>One of my colleagues was just at a conference where they saw a presentation about using data to solve a problem where data had previously not been abundant. The speaker claimed the data were &amp;ldquo;big data&amp;rdquo; and a question from the audience was: &amp;ldquo;Well, that isn&amp;rsquo;t really big data is it, it is only X Gigabytes&amp;rdquo;.
While that exact question would elicit groans from most people who work with data, I think it highlights one of the key problems with the thinking around data science.</description>

      <description>Jeff and I had a chance to interview Michael Eisen, a co-founder of the Public Library of Science, HHMI Investigator, and a Professor at UC Berkeley. We talked with him about publishing in open access and how young investigators might publish in open access journals under the current system. Watch part 1 of the interview above.</description>

      <title>Are MOOC&#39;s fundamentally flawed? Or is it a problem with statistical literacy?</title>

      <description>People know I have taught a MOOC on Data Analysis, so I frequently get emails about updates on the &amp;ldquo;state of MOOCs&amp;rdquo;. It definitely feels like the wild west of education is happening right now. If you make an analogy to air travel, I would say we are about here:
 So of course I feel like it is a bit premature for quotes like this:  Two years after a Stanford professor drew 160,000 students from around the globe to a free online course on artificial intelligence, starting what was widely viewed as a revolution in higher education, early results for such large-scale courses are disappointing, forcing a rethinking of how college instruction can best use the Internet.</description>

      <description>NYC mayor-elect Bill de Blasio is expected to name William J. Bratton to lead the NYPD. Bratton has been commissioner before (1994-1996) so I was curious to see the crime rates during his tenure, which was within the period that saw an impressive drop (1990-2010). Here is the graph of violent crimes per 100,000 inhabitants for NYC NY state for year 1965-2012 (divided by commissioner). Will Bratton be able to continue the trend?</description>

      <description>In a New York Times op-ed titled Migration Hurts the Homeland, Paul Collier tells us that
 What’s good for migrants from poor places is not always good for the countries they’re leaving behind.  He makes the argument that those that favor open immigration don&#39;t realize that they are actually hurting &#34;the poor&#34; more than they are helping. This post is not about the issue of whether migration is bad for the homeland (I know of others that make the opposite claim) but rather about the opinions I have formed by leaving my homeland to become an academic in a US research university.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m in Australia for Bioinfo Summer 2013! First time in Australia and excited about the great lineup of speakers and to meet a bunch of people at the University of Adelaide.  An interesting post about how CS has become the de facto language of our times. They specifically talk about CS50 at Harvard. I think in terms of being an informed citizen CS and Statistics are quickly being added to Reading, Writing, and Arithmetic as the required baseline knowledge (link via Alex N.</description>

      <description>Yesterday my data sharing policy went a little bit viral. It hit the front page of Hacker News and was a trending repo on Github. I was reading the comments on Hacker News and came across this gem:
 So, while I can imagine there are good Frequentists Statisticians out there, I insist that frequentism itself is bogus.
 This is the extension of a long standing debate about the relative merits of frequentist and Bayesian statistical methods.</description>

      <description>Jeff and I had an opportunity to sit down with Daphne Koller, Co-Founder of Coursera and Rajeev Motwani Professor of Computer Science at Stanford University. Jeff and I both teach massive open online courses using the Coursera platform and it was great to be able to talk with Professor Koller about the changing nature of education today.
Some highlights:
 [1:35] On the origins of Coursera: &amp;ldquo;I actually came to that realization when listening to talk about YouTube, and realizing that, why does it make sense for me to come and deliver the same lecture year after year after year where I could package it in much smaller bite size chunks that were much more fun and much more cohesive and then use the class time for engaging with students in more meaningful ways.</description>

I decided to write a summary of take home messages from our speakers at the Unconference. You can read it on Github here. I put it on Github for two reasons:

      <description>Last I week I participated in the Future of the Statistical Sciences Workshop. I arrived feeling somewhat pessimistic about the future of our discipline. My pessimism stemmed from the emergence of the term Data Science and the small role academic (bio)statistics department are playing in the excitement and initiatives surrounding it. Data Science centers/departments/initiatives are propping up in universities without much interaction with (bio)statistics departments. Funding agencies, interested in supporting Data Science, are not always including academic statisticians in the decision making process.</description>

      <description>Marie Davidian, the President of the American Statistical Association, writes about the JHU Biostatistics effort to deliver massive open online courses. She interviewed Jeff, Brian Caffo, and me and summarized our thoughts.
 All acknowledge that the future is unknown. How MOOCs will affect degree programs remains to be seen. Roger notes that the MOOCs he, Jeff, Brian, and others offer seem to attract many students who would likely not enter a degree program at Hopkins, regardless, so may be filling a niche that will not result in increased degree enrollments.</description>

      <description>My group collaborates with many different scientists and the number one determinant of how fast we can turn around results is the status of the data we receive from our collaborators. If the data are well organized and all the important documentation is there, it dramatically speeds up the analysis time.
I recently had the experience where a postdoc requesting help with an analysis provided an amazing summary of the data she wanted analyzed.</description>

      <description>How long do hard drives last?
 Backblaze has kept up to 25,000 hard drives constantly online for the last four years. Every time a drive fails, they note it down, then slot in a replacement. After four years, Backblaze now has some amazing data and graphs that detail the failure rate of hard drives over the first four years of their life.
 I guess it&amp;rsquo;s easier to do this with hard drives than it is for people.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been playing with my new iPhone 5s for the last few weeks, and first let me just say that it&amp;rsquo;s an awesome phone. Don&amp;rsquo;t listen to whatever Jeff says. It&amp;rsquo;s probably worth it just for the camera, but I&amp;rsquo;ve been particularly interested in the behavior of Apple&amp;rsquo;s fingerprint sensor (a.k.a. Touch ID). Before the phone came out, there were persistent rumors of a fingerprint sensor from now-defunct AuthenTec, and I wondered how the sensor would work given that it was unlikely to be perfect.</description>

      <description>Big data is so last year.
 Collecting data from all sorts of odd places and analyzing it much faster than was possible even a couple of years ago has become one of the hottest areas of the technology industry. The idea is simple: With all that processing power and a little creativity, researchers should be able to find novel patterns and relationships among different kinds of information. For the last few years, insiders have been calling this sort of analysis Big Data.</description>

In preparing for the event, we learned a lot about how to organize such an event and frankly we wished there had been a bit more organized documentation on how to do this. The various Google web sites were full of nice videos demonstrating how cool the technology is, but not much in the way of specific instructions on how to get it done.</description>

      <description>There has been a big knockdown-dragout battle in the blogosphere over how GTEX is doing their analysis. Read the original post here, my summary here, and the response from GTEX here. I agree that the criticism bordered on hyperbolic but also think that methods matter. I also think that consortia are under pressure to get something out and have to use software that works, I&amp;rsquo;m sympathetic cause that must be a tough position to be in, but it is important to remember software runs !</description>

 Ask questions for our speakers on Twitter with the hashtag #futureofstats. Don&amp;rsquo;t wait, start right now, Roger, Rafa, and I are monitoring the hashtag and collecting questions. We will pick some to ask the speakers tomorrow during the Unconference.  If you have an idea about the future of statistics write it up, post it on Github, on Blogger, on WordPress, on your personal website, then tweet it with the hashtag #futureofstats.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been digging up old &amp;ldquo;future of statistics&amp;rdquo; writings from the past in anticipation of our Unconference on the Future of Statistics this Wednesday 12-1pm EDT. Last week I mentioned Daryl Pregibon&amp;rsquo;s experience trying to build statistical expertise into software. One classic is &amp;ldquo;The Future of Data Analysis&amp;rdquo; by John Tukey published in the Annals of Mathematical Statistics in 1962.
Perhaps the most surprising aspect of this paper is how relevant it remains today.</description>

      <description>Pubmed Commons is a new post-publication commenting system. I think this is a great idea and I hope it succeeds. Right now it is in &amp;ldquo;private beta&amp;rdquo; so only people with Pubmed Commons accounts can post/view comments. But you can follow along with who is making comments via this neat twitter bot. I think the main feature this lacks to be a hugely successful experiment is some way to give real, tangible academic credit to commenters.</description>

      <description>In anticipation of the upcoming Unconference on the Future of Statistics next Wednesday at 12-1pm EDT, I thought I&amp;rsquo;d dig up what people in the past had said about the future so we can see how things turned out. In doing this I came across an old National Academy of Sciences report from 1991 on the Future of Statistical Software. This was a panel discussion hosted by the National Research Council and summarized in this volume.</description>

      <description>There has been a lot of discussion of peer review on this blog and elsewhere. One thing I realized is that no one ever formally taught me the point of peer review or how to write a review.
Like a lot of other people, I have been frustrated by the peer review process. I also now frequently turn to my students to perform supervised peer review of papers, both for their education and because I can&amp;rsquo;t handle the large number of peer review requests I get on my own.</description>

      <description>There was a flurry of activity on social media yesterday surrounding a blog post by Lior Pachter. He was speaking about the GTEX project - a large NIH funded project that has the goal of understanding expression variation within and among human beings. The project has measured gene expression in multiple tissues of over 900 individuals.
In the post, the author claims that the GTEX project is &amp;ldquo;throwing away&amp;rdquo; 90% of its data.</description>

      <description>During Saturday&amp;rsquo;s ALCS game 6 the Red Sox&amp;rsquo;s manager John Farrell took out his starter in the 6th inning. They were leading by 1, but had runners on first and second with no outs. This is a hard situation to get out of without giving up a run. The chances of scoring with an average pitcher are about 64%. I am sure that with a top of the line pitcher, like Koji Uehara, this number goes down substantially.</description>

      <description>In my last post, I talked about two general approaches to conducting statistical research: platforms and integration. In this followup I thought I&amp;rsquo;d describe the characteristics of certain fields that suggesting taking one approach over another.
I think in practice, most statisticians will dedicate some time to both the platform and integrative approaches to doing statistical research because different approaches work better in different situations. The question then is not &amp;ldquo;Which approach is better?</description>

      <description>In the technology world today, one of the common topics of interest is the so-called &amp;ldquo;war&amp;rdquo; between Apple and Google (or Android). This war is ostensibly over dominance of the mobile phone industry, where Apple sells the most popular phone but Google/Android (as an operating system) controls over half the market. (Android phones themselves are manufactured by a variety of companies and no one of those companies sells more phones than Apple.</description>

      <description>The Lego Mindstorm kit provides software and hardware to create programmable robots. A very simple first task is figuring out how to make the robot move any given distance. You get to program the number of wheel rotations. The video below shows how one can use this to motivate and teach least squares. We assumed the formula was distance = K × rotations, collected data for 1,2&amp;hellip;, 10 rotations, then used R to motivate (via plots) and calculate the least squares estimate of K.</description>

      <description>_Lars Peter Hansen won the Nobel Prize in economics for creating the generalized method of moments. A rather technical explanation of the idea appears on Wikipedia. These are a good set of lecture notes on gmms if you like math. I went over to Marginal Revolution to see what was being written about the Nobel Prize winners. Clearly a bunch of other people were doing the same thing as the site was pretty slow to load.</description>

On a related note, it will be interesting to see how/whether the traditional educational system will be disrupted. I&amp;rsquo;m as into the MOOC thing as the next guy, but I&amp;rsquo;m not sure I buy a series of pictures from your computer as &amp;ldquo;validation&amp;rdquo; you took/know the material for a course. Also I&amp;rsquo;m not 100% sure about what this is, but it has the potential to be kind of awesome - the Moocdemic.</description>

      <description>Arthur Benjamini says we should teach statistics before calculus. He points out that most of what we do in high school math is preparing us for calculus. He makes the point that while physicists, engineers and economists need calculus, in the digital age, discrete math, probability and statistics are much more relevant to everyone else. I agree with him and was happy to see Statistics as part of the common core.</description>

      <description>Editor’s Note: This post written by Roger Peng is part of a two-part series on Scientist-Statistician interactions. The first post was written by Elizabeth C. Matsui, an Associate Professor in the Division of Allergy and Immunology at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine.
This post is a followup to Elizabeth Matsui’s previous post for scientists/clinicians on collaborating with biostatisticians. Elizabeth and I have been working for over half a decade and I think the story of how we started working together is perhaps a brief lesson on collaboration in and of itself.</description>

I’ve been collaborating with Roger for several years now and we have had quite a few discussions about characteristics of a successful collaboration between a clinical investigator and a biostatistician. I can’t remember for certain, but think that this cartoon may have been the impetus for some of our discussions.</description>

      <description>A fascinating read about applying decision theory to mathematical proofs. They talk about Type I and Type II errors and everything.  Statistical concepts explained through dance. Even for a pretty culture-deficient dude like me this is cool. Lots of good talks from the WIN Workshop, including by one of our speakers for the Unconference on the Future of Statistics. The best advice for graduate students (or any academics) I have seen in my time writing the Sunday Links.</description>

      <description>Editor&amp;rsquo;s note: Simply Statistics is still freaking out about the government shut down and potential impending economic catastrophe if the debt ceiling isn&amp;rsquo;t raised. Since anything new we might write seems trivial compared to what is going on in Washington, we are reposting an awesome old piece by Roger on finding good collaborators. 
The job of the statistician is almost entirely about collaboration. Sure, there’s theoretical work that we can do by ourselves, but most of the impact that we have on science comes from our work with scientists in other fields.</description>

      <description>[](http://www.nature.com/news/mozilla-plan-seeks-to-debug-scientific-code-1.13812) appeared a couple of days ago in Nature describing Mozilla&amp;rsquo;s efforts to implement code review for scientific papers. As anyone who follows our blog knows, we are in favor of reproducible research, in favor of disclosing code, and in favor of open science.
So people were surprised when they saw this quote from Roger at the end of the Nature piece:
 “One worry I have is that, with reviews like this, scientists will be even more discouraged from publishing their code.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on &amp;ldquo;big&amp;rdquo; data in genomics since I was a first year student in graduate school (a longer time than I&amp;rsquo;d rather admit). At the time, &amp;ldquo;big&amp;rdquo; meant microarray studies with a couple of hundred patients. Of course, that is now a really small drop in the pond compared to the huge sequencing data sets, like the one published recently in Nature.
Despite the exploding size of these genomic data sets, the discovery process is almost always limited by the quality and quantity of useful metadata that go along with them.</description>

We here at Simply Statistics are pumped about the Statistics 2013 Future of Statistical Sciences Workshop (Nov. 11-12). It is a great time to be a statistician and discussing the future of our discipline is of utmost importance to us. In fact, we liked the idea so much that we decided to get in the game ourselves. We are super excited to announce the first ever “Unconference” hosted by Simply Statistics.</description>

      <description>To promote research and education in statistical genetics and genomics, some of us in the community would like to establish a statistical genetics and genomics section of the American Statistical Association (ASA). Having an ASA section gives us certain advantages, such as having allocated invited sessions at JSM, young investigator and student awards, and senior investigator awards in statistical genetics and genomics, as well as a community to interact and exchange information.</description>

      <description>Last week I talked about how we might be able to improve data analyses by moving towards &amp;ldquo;evidence-based&amp;rdquo; data analysis and to use data analytic techniques that are proven to be useful based on statistical research rather. My feeling was this approach attacks the most &amp;ldquo;upstream&amp;rdquo; aspect of data analysis before problems have the chance to filter down into things like publications, or even worse, clinical decision-making.

      <title>Repost: A proposal for a really fast statistics journal</title>

      <guid>/2013/09/04/repost-a-proposal-for-a-really-fast-statistics-journal/</guid>
      <description>Editor&amp;rsquo;s note: This is a repost of a previous Simply Statistics column that seems to be relevant again in light of Marie Davidian&amp;rsquo;s really important column on the peer review process. You should also check out Yihui&amp;rsquo;s thoughts on this, which verge on the creation of a very fast/dynamic stats journal. 
I know we need a new journal like we need a good poke in the eye. But I got fired up by the recent discussion of open science (by Paul Krugman and others) and the seriously misguided Research Works Act- that aimed to make it illegal to deposit published papers funded by the government in Pubmed central or other open access databases.</description>

      <description>There has been a lot of discussion of the importance of open access on Twitter. I am 100% in favor of open access (I do wish it was less expensive), but I also think that sometimes people lose sight of other important issues for junior scientists that go beyond open access. Dr. Isis has agreat example of this on her blog.  Sherri R. has a great list of resources for stats minded folks at the undergrad, grad, and faculty levels.</description>

      <description>Last week I posted about how I thought the notion of reproducible research did not go far enough to address the question of whether you could trust that a given data analysis was conducted appropriately. From some of the discussion on the post, it seems some of you thought I believed therefore that reproducibility had no value. That’s definitely not true and I’m hoping I can clarify my thinking in this followup post.</description>

      <description>This past Thursday, the NASDAQ stock exchange shut down for just over 3 hours due to some technical problems. It&amp;rsquo;s still not clear what the problem was because NASDAQ officials are being tight-lipped. NASDAQ has had a bad run of problems recently, the most visible was the botching of the Facebook initial public offering.
Stock trading these days is a highly technical business involving complex algorithms and multiple exchanges spread across the country.</description>

      <description>For the past several years a steady stream of news articles and opinion pieces have been praising the virtues of Finish schools and exalting the US to imitate this system. One data point supporting this view comes from the most recent PISA scores (2009) in which Finland outscored the US 536 to 500. Several people have pointed out that this is an apples (huge and diverse) to oranges (small and homogeneous) comparison.</description>

      <description>Chris Lane was tragically killed (link via Leah J.) in a shooting in Duncan, Oklahoma. According to the reports, it sounds like it was apparently a random and completely senseless act of violence. It is horrifying to think that those kids were just looking around for someone to kill because they were bored.
Gun violence in the U.S. is way too common and I&amp;rsquo;m happy about efforts to reduce the chance of this type of event.</description>

      <description>Discussions about reproducibility in scientific research have been on the rise lately, including on this blog. There are many underlying trends that have produced this increased interest in reproducibility: larger and larger studies being harder to replicate independently, cheaper data collection technologies/methods producing larger datasets, cheaper computing power allowing for more sophisticated analyses (even for small datasets), and the rise of general computational science (for every “X” we now have “Computational X”).</description>

Ramnath Vaidyanathan has a nice summary of the talk and the Q&amp;amp;A afterwards. Among other things, Silver encouraged people to start a blog and communicate directly with the public.

      <description>Andrew Gelman&amp;rsquo;s recent post on what he calls the &amp;ldquo;scientific mass production of spurious statistical significance&amp;rdquo; reminded me of a thought I had back when I read John Ioannidis&amp;rsquo; paper claiming that most published research finding are false. Many authors, which I will refer to as the pessimists, have joined Ioannidis in making similar claims and repeatedly blaming the current state of affairs on the mindless use of frequentist inference. The gist of my thought is that, for some scientific fields, the pessimist&amp;rsquo;s criticism is missing a critical point: that in practice, there is an inverse relationship between increasing rates of true discoveries and decreasing rates of false discoveries and that true discoveries from fields such as the biomedical sciences provide an enormous benefit to society.</description>

      <description>An important concept that is only recently gaining the attention it deserves is researcher degrees of freedom. From Simmons et al.:
 The culprit is a construct we refer to as researcher degrees of freedom. In the course of collecting and analyzing data, researchers have many decisions to make: Should more data be collected? Should some observations be excluded? Which conditions should be combined and which ones compared? Which control variables should be considered?</description>

I only hope that more of the superstars that fly under the radar of the general public but have made huge contributions to science/medicine (like Ross Prentice, Terry Speed, Scott Zeger, or others that were highlighted in the comments here) get the same kind of attention (although I suspect they might not want it).</description>

It was cool to see the diversity of opinions and all the impressive people working in our field. We realized that another question we didn&amp;rsquo;t have a great answer to was:
 What are the 5 most influential statistics papers of the aughts (2000-2010)?
 Now that the auggies or aughts or whatever are a few years behind us, we have the benefit of a little hindsight and can get a reasonable measure of retrospective impact.</description>

      <description>Let&amp;rsquo;s shake up the social sciences is a piece in the New York Times by Nicholas Christakis who rose to fame by claiming that obesity is contagious. Gelman responds that he thinks maybe Christakis got a little ahead of himself. I&amp;rsquo;m going to stay out of this one as it is all pretty far outside my realm - but I will say that I think quantitative social sciences is a hot area and all hot areas bring both interesting new results and hype.</description>

      <description>At first blush the news out of San Jose State that the partnership with Udacity is being temporarily suspended is bad news for MOOCs. It is particularly bad news since the main reason for the suspension is poor student performance on exams. I think in the PR game there is certainly some reason to be disappointed in the failure of this first big experiment, but as someone who loves the idea of high-throughput education, I think that this is primarily a good learning experience.</description>

      <description>I have been thinking for a while how hard it is to find statisticians to interview for the blog. When I started the interview series, it was targeted at interviewing statisticians at the early stages of their careers. It is relatively easy, if you work in academic statistics, to name 5 famous statisticians. If you asked me to do that, I&amp;rsquo;d probably say something like: Efron, Tibshirani, Irizarry, Prentice, and Storey.</description>

      <description>This saturday the New York Times published an opinion pieces wondering &amp;ldquo;do clinical trials work?&amp;rdquo;. The answer, of course, is: absolutely. For those that don&amp;rsquo;t know the history, randomized control trials (RCTs) are one of the reasons why life spans skyrocketed in the 20th century. Before RCTs wishful thinking and arrogance lead numerous well-meaning scientist and doctors to incorrectly believe their treatments worked. They are so successful that they have been adopted with much fanfare in far flung arenas like poverty alleviation (see e.</description>

      <description>Question: Do clinical trials work?Answer: Yes. Clinical trials are one of the defining success stories in the process of scientific inquiry. Do they work as fast/efficiently as a pharma company with potentially billions on the line would like? That is definitely much more up for debate. Most of the article is a good summary of how drug development works - although I think the statistics reporting is a little prone to hyperbole.</description>

      <description>This article in the New York Times about the supposed death of photography got me thinking about statistics. Apparently, the death of photography has been around the corner for some time now:
 For years, photographers have been bracing for this moment, warned that the last rites will be read for photography when video technology becomes good enough for anyone to record. But as this Fourth of July showed me, I think the reports of the death of photography have been greatly exaggerated.</description>

      <description>Checklist mania has hit clinical medicine thanks to people like Peter Pronovost and many others. The basic idea is that simple and short checklists along with changes to clinical culture can prevent major errors from occurring in medical practice. One particular success story is Pronovost’s central line checklist which dramatically reduced bloodstream infections in hospital intensive care units.
There are three important points about the checklist. First, it neatly summarizes information, bringing the latest evidence directly to clinical practice.</description>

It seems like everywhere we look, data is being generated - from politics, to biology, to publishing, to social networks. There are also diverse new computational tools, like GPGPU and cloud computing, that expand the statistical toolbox. Statistical theory is more advanced than its ever been, with exciting work in a range of areas.
With all the excitement going on around statistics, there is also increasing diversity.</description>

      <description>One topic I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking about recently is extent to which data analysis is an art versus a science. In my thinking about art and science, I rely on Don Knuth&amp;rsquo;s distinction, from his 1974 lecture &amp;ldquo;Computer Programming as an Art&amp;rdquo;:
 Science is knowledge that we understand so well that we can teach it to a computer; and if we don&amp;rsquo;t fully understand something, it is an art to deal with it.</description>

      <description>There&amp;rsquo;s a nice piece by Mark Hansen about data-driven aesthetics in the New York Times special section on big data.
 From a speedometer to a weather map to a stock chart, we routinely interpret and act on data displayed visually. With a few exceptions, data has no natural “look,” no natural “visualization,” and choices have to be made about how it should be displayed. Each choice can reveal certain kinds of patterns in the data while hiding others.</description>

      <description>Whether you know it or not, everything you do produces data - from the websites you read to the rate at which your heart beats. Until pretty recently, most of the data you produced wasn’t collected, it floated off unmeasured. The only data that were collected were painstakingly gathered by scientists one number at a time in small experiments with a few people. This laborious process meant that data were expensive and time-consuming to collect.</description>

      <description>There has been a lot of discussion of personalized medicine, individualized health, and precision medicine in the news and in the medical research community. Despite this recent attention, it is clear that healthcare has always been personalized to some extent. For example, men are rarely pregnant and heart attacks occur more often among older patients. In these cases, easily collected variables such as sex and age, can be used to predict health outcomes and therefore used to &amp;ldquo;personalize&amp;rdquo; healthcare for those individuals.</description>

He designs a study, collects some data, conducts an appropriate statistical analysis and concludes that D &amp;gt; 0. This result is published in the Journal of Awesome Results along with all the details of how the study was done.</description>

Some of these results have had major non-scientific consequences, which is the reason they have drawn so much attention both inside and outside of the academic community. For example, the Duke saga [Recently there have been some high profile flameouts in scientific research.</description>

      <description>One element about the entire discussion about reproducible research that I haven&amp;rsquo;t seen talked about very much is the potential for the lack of reciprocity. I think even if scientists were not concerned about the possibility of getting scooped by others by making their data/code available this issue would be sufficient to give people pause about making their work reproducible.
What do I mean by reciprocity? Consider the following (made up) scenario:</description>

      <title>Mindlessly normalizing genomics data is bad - but ignoring unwanted variability can be worse</title>

      <guid>/2013/04/26/mindlessly-normalizing-genomics-data-is-bad-but-ignoring-unwanted-variability-can-be-worse/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, and bleeding over into today, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12538238&#34;&gt;quantile normalization&lt;/a&gt; (QN) was being discussed on Twitter. This is the &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/mbeisen/status/327563522185764864&#34;&gt;Yesterday, and bleeding over into today, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12538238&#34;&gt;quantile normalization&lt;/a&gt; (QN) was being discussed on Twitter. This is the&lt;/a&gt; that started the whole thing off. The conversation went a bunch of different directions and then this happened:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;well, this happens all over bio-statistics - ie, naive use in seemingly undirected ways until you get a &amp;ldquo;good&amp;rdquo; pvalue. And then end&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So Jeff and I felt it was important to respond - since we are biostatisticians that work in genomics. We felt a couple of points were worth making:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Most statisticians we know, including us, know QN&amp;rsquo;s limitations and are always nervous about using QN&lt;/strong&gt;. But with most datasets we see, unwanted variability is overwhelming  and we are left with no choice but to normalize in orde to extract anything useful from the data.  In fact, many times QN is not enough and we have to apply further transformations, e.g., to remove &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20838408&#34;&gt;batch effects&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2. &lt;strong&gt;We would be curious to know which biostatisticians were being referred to. &lt;/strong&gt;We would like some examples, because most of the genomic statisticians we know work very closely with biologists to aid them in cleaning dirty data to help them find real sources of signal. Furthermore, we encourage biologists to validate their results. In many cases, quantile normalization (or other transforms) are critical to finding results that validate and there is a long literature (both biological and statistical) supporting the importance of appropriate normalization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3. &lt;strong&gt;Assuming the data that you get (sequences, probe intensities, etc.) from high-throughput tech = direct measurement of abundance is incorrect.&lt;/strong&gt; Before worrying about QN (or other normalization) being an arbitrary transformation that distorts the data, keep in mind that what you want to measure has already been distorted by PCR, the imperfections of the microarray, scanner measurement error, image bleeding, cross hybridization or alignment artifacts, ozone effects, etc&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To go into a little more detail about the reasons that normalization may be important in many cases, so I have written a little more detail below with data if you are interested.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>There&amp;rsquo;s an interesting parallel between the Nevins-Potti debacle (a true debacle, in my mind) and the recent Reinhart-Rogoff kerfuffle. Both were exposed via some essentially small detail that had nothing to do with the real problem.
In the case of Reinhart-Rogoff, the Excel error was what made them look ridiculous, but it was in fact the &amp;ldquo;unconventional weighting&amp;rdquo; of the data that had the most dramatic effect. Furthermore, ever since the paper had come out, academic economists were debating and challenging its conclusions from the get go.</description>

Quick background: Carmen Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff wrote an influential paper that was used by many to justify the need for austerity measures taken by governments to reduce debts relative to GDP. Yesterday, Thomas Herndon, Michael Ash, and Robert Pollin (HAP) released a paper where they reproduced the Reinhart-Rogoff (RR) analysis and noted a few irregularities or errors.</description>

As I mentioned in the post-mortem podcast I knew in advance that it was likely to be the most controversial component of the class.

We&amp;rsquo;re looking for someone who wants to work on (and solve!) real research problems in the biomedical sciences and address the growing need for reproducible research tools. The position would be in the Department of Biostatistics at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health and would be jointly advised by Jeff and myself.</description>

      <description>Here are my picks for ENAR sessions today (Wednesday):
 8:30-10:15am: Large Data Visualization and Exploration, Grand Ballroom 4 (make sure you stay till the end to see Karl Broman); Innovative Methods in Causal Inference with Applications to Mediation, Neuroimaging, and Infectious Diseases, Grand Ballroom 8A; Next Generation Sequencing, Grand Ballroom 5 10:30am-12:15pm: Statistical Information Integration of -Omics Data, Grand Ballrooms 1 &amp;amp; 2  Okay, so this schedule actually requires me to split myself in to three separate entities.</description>

      <description>This week is the annual ENAR meeting, the big biostatistics conference, in Orlando, Florida. It actually started on Sunday but I haven&amp;rsquo;t gotten around to looking at the program (obviously, I&amp;rsquo;m not there right now). Flipping through the program now, here&amp;rsquo;s what looks good to me for Tuesday:
 8:30-10:15am: Functional Neuroimaging Decompositions, Grand Ballroom 3  10:30am-12:15pm: Hmm&amp;hellip;I guess you should go to the Presidential Invited Address, Grand Ballroom 7 1:45-3:30pm: JABES Showcase, Grand Ballroom 8A; Statistical Body Language: Analytical Methods for Wearable Computing, Grand Ballroom 4 3:45-5:30pm: Big Data: Wearable Computing, Crowdsourcing, Space Telescopes, and Brain Imaging, Grand Ballroom 8A; Sample Size Planning for Clinical Development, Grand Ballroom 6  That&amp;rsquo;s right, you can pack in two sessions on wearable computing today if you want.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been writing a blog for a few years now, but it started after I was already comfortably settled in a tenure track job. There have been some huge benefits of writing a scientific blog. It has certainly raised my visibility and given me opportunities to talk about issues that are a little outside of my usual research agenda. It has also inspired more than one research project that has ended up in a full blown peer-reviewed publication.</description>

      <description>Simulation is commonly used by statisticians/data analysts to: (1) estimate variability/improve predictors, (2) to evaluate the space of potential outcomes, and (3) to evaluate the properties of new algorithms or procedures. Over the last couple of days, discussions of simulation have popped up in a couple of different places.
First, the reviewers of a paper that my student is working on had asked a question about the behavior of the method in different conditions.</description>

      <description>There&amp;rsquo;s a nice article by Nick Bilton in the New York Times Bits blog about the need for context when looking at Big Data. Actually, the article starts off by describing how Google&amp;rsquo;s Flu Trends model overestimated the number of people infected with flue in the U.S. this season, but then veers off into a more general discussion about Big Data.
My favorite quote comes from Mark Hansen:
 “Data inherently has all of the foibles of being human,” said Mark Hansen, director of the David and Helen Gurley Brown Institute for Media Innovation at Columbia University.</description>

      <description>A really nice example where epidemiological studies are later confirmed by a randomized trial. From a statistician&amp;rsquo;s point of view, this is the idealized way that science would work. First, data that are relatively cheap (observational/retrospective studies) are used to identify potential associations of interest. After a number of these studies show a similar effect, a randomized study is performed to confirm what we suspected from the cheaper studies. Joe Blitzstein talking about the &amp;ldquo;Soul of Statistics&amp;rdquo;, we interviewed Joe a while ago.</description>

      <description>Netflix is using data to create original content for its subscribers, the first example of which was House of Cards. Three main data points for this show were that (1) People like David Fincher (because they watch The Social Network, like, all the time); (2) People like Kevin Spacey; and (3) People liked the British version of House of Cards. Netflix obviously has tons of other data, including when you stop, pause, rewind certain scenes in a movie or TV show.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve enjoyed so far the back and forth between Tesla Motors and New York Times reporter John Broder. The short version is
 Broder tested one of Tesla&amp;rsquo;s new Model S all-electric sedans on a drive from Washington, D.C. to Groton, CT. Part of the reason for this specific trip was to make use of Tesla&amp;rsquo;s new supercharger stations along the route (one in Delaware and one in Connecticut). Broder&amp;rsquo;s trip appeared to have some bumps, including running out of electricity at one point and requiring a tow.</description>

That means that I help scientists and doctors analyze their medical data to try to figure out new screening tools, new therapies, and new ways to improve patients&amp;rsquo; health. I&amp;rsquo;m also a professor. I spend a good fraction of my time teaching students about analyzing data in classes here at my university and online. Big data/data analysis is an area of growth for the U.S. economy and some have even suggested that there will be a critical shortage of trained data analysts.</description>

I wonder if they have an intern in the basement manually annotating those features or if they are using automatic detection algorithms (via Marginal Revolution).</description>

      <description>The Lakers recently snapped a four game losing streak. In that game Kobe, the league leader in field goal attempts and missed shots, had a season low of 14 points but a season high of 14 assists. This makes sense to me since Kobe shooting less means more efficient players are shooting more. Kobe has a lower career true shooting % than Gasol, Howard and Nash (ranked 17,3 and 2 respectively).</description>

The open source community is also filled with advocates and researchers who know way more about this than I do.</description>

      <description>Recent reports of air pollution levels out of Beijing are very very disturbing. Levels of fine particulate matter (PM2.5, or PM less than 2.5 microns in diameter) have reached unprecedented levels. So high are the levels that even the official media are allowed to mention it.
Here is a photograph of downtown Beijing during the day (Thanks to Sarah E. Burton for the photograph). Hourly levels of PM2.5 hit over 900 micrograms per cubic meter in some parts of the city and 24-hour average levels (the basis for most air quality standards) reached over 500 micrograms per cubic meter.</description>

      <description>These are some great talks. But definitely watch Michael Eisen&amp;rsquo;s talk on E-biomed and the history of open access publication. This is particularly poigniant in light of Aaron Swartz&amp;rsquo;s tragic suicide. It&amp;rsquo;s also worth checking out the twitter hashtag #pdftribute . An awesome flowchart before a talk given by the creator of the R twotuorials. Roger gets a shoutout (via civilstat). This blog selects a position at random on the planet earth every day and posts the picture taken closest to that point.</description>

      <description>I have been getting some questions via email, LinkedIn, and Twitter about the content of the Data Analysis class I will be teaching for Coursera. Data Analysis and Data Science mean different things to different people. So I made a video describing how Data Analysis fits into the landscape of other quantitative classes here:
Here is the corresponding presentation. I also made a tentative list of topics we will cover, subject to change at the instructor&amp;rsquo;s whim.</description>

      <description>It is no secret that faculty evaluations at top universities weigh research much more than teaching. This is not surprising given that, among other reasons, global visibility comes from academic innovation (think Nobel Prizes) not classroom instruction. Come promotion time the peer review system carefully examines your publication record and ability to raise research funds. External experts within your research area are asked if you are a leader in the field.</description>

      <description>Not really statistics, but this is an interesting article about how rational optimization by individual actors does not always lead to an optimal solutiohn. Related, ere is the coolest street sign I think I&amp;rsquo;ve ever seen, with a heatmap of traffic density to try to influence commuters. An interesting paper that talks about how clustering is only a really hard problem when there aren&amp;rsquo;t obvious clusters. I was a little disappointed in the paper, because it defines the &amp;ldquo;obviousness&amp;rdquo; of clusters only theoretically by a distance metric.</description>

      <description>_Editor&amp;rsquo;s Note: In a recent post we disagreed with a Nature article claiming that NIH doesn&amp;rsquo;t support innovation. Our colleague Steven Salzberg actually looked at the data and wrote the guest post below. _
Nature published an article last month with the provocative title &amp;ldquo;Research grants: Conform and be funded.&amp;rdquo; The authors looked at papers with over 1000 citations to find out whether scientists &amp;ldquo;who do the most influential scientific work get funded by the NIH.</description>

      <description>The Connecticut Medical Examiner has asked to sequence and study the DNA of the recent Newtown shooter. I&amp;rsquo;ve been seeing this pop up over the last few days on a lot of popular media sites, where they mention some objections scientists (or geneticists) may have to this &amp;ldquo;scientific&amp;rdquo; study. But I haven&amp;rsquo;t seen the objections explicitly laid out anywhere. So here are mine.
Ignoring the fundamentals of the genetics of complex disease: If the violent behavior of the shooter has any genetic underpinning, it is complex.</description>

      <description>I have a Fitbit. I got it because I wanted to collect some data about myself and I liked the simplicity of the set-up. I also asked around and Fitbit seemed like the most &amp;ldquo;open&amp;rdquo; platform for collecting one&amp;rsquo;s own data. You have to pay $50 for a premium account, but after that, they allow you to download your data.
Or do they?
I looked into the details, asked a buddy or two, and found out that you actually can&amp;rsquo;t get the really interesting minute-by-minute data even with a premium account.</description>

It is a great time to be a statistician and I am hoping more people will join the fun. In fact, as we like to point out in this blog, Statistics has already been at the center of many exciting accomplishments of the 21st century. Sabermetrics has become a standard approach and inspired the Hollywood movie Money Ball.</description>

Here&amp;rsquo;s a post describing it on the heathdata.gov blog. As far as I can tell, the app is still in beta, so only the folks who have a code can download it.

      <description>A cool data visualization for blood glucose levels for diabetic individuals. This kind of interactive visualization can help people see where/when major health issues arise for chronic diseases. This was a class project by Jeff Heer&amp;rsquo;s Stanford CS448B students Ben Rudolph and Reno Bowen (twitter @RenoBowen). Speaking of interactive visualizations, I also got this link from Patrick M. It looks like a way to build interactive graphics and my understanding is it is compatible with R data frames, worth checking out (plus, Dex is a good name).</description>

      <description>This recent Nature paper makes the controversial claim that the most innovative (interpreted as best) scientists are not being funded by NIH. Not surprisingly, it is getting a lot of attention in the popular media. The title and introduction make it sound like there is a pervasive problem biasing the funding enterprise against innovative scientists. To me this appears counterintuitive given how much innovation, relative to other funding agencies around the world, comes out of NIH funded researchers (here is a recent example) and how many of the best biomedical investigators in the world elect to work for NIH funded institutions.</description>

I completely agree that this is a good way to learn through osmosis, learn about debugging, and often pick up the reasons for particular coding tricks (this is how I learned about vectorized calculations in Matlab, by re-typing and running my advisors code back in my youth).</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m not the first one to suggest that Biostatistics has been undervalued in the scientific community, and some of the shortcomings of epidemiology and biostatistics have been noted elsewhere. But this previous work focuses primarily on the contributions of statistics/biostatistics at the purely scientific level.
The Cox Proportional Hazards model is one of the most widely used statistical models in the analysis of data from clinical trials and other medical studies.</description>

      <description>A directory of open access journals. Very cool idea to aggregate them. Here is a blog post from one of my favorite statistics bloggers about why open-access journals are so cool. Just like in a lot of other areas, open access journals can be thought of as an open data initiative. Here is a website that displays data on the relative wealth of neighborhoods, broken down by census track. It&amp;rsquo;s pretty fascinating to take a look and see what the income changes are, even in regions pretty close to each other.</description>

While I had previously announced that the course would be presented again right here, it made more sense to do it again on Coursera where it is (still) free and the platform there is much richer. For those of you who missed it the last time around, this is your chance to take it and learn a little R.</description>

However, it turns out that rocket scientists can also benefit.

      <description>When I was a kid growing up in rough-and-tumble suburban New York, one of the major summer activities was roller hockey, the kind with roller blades (remember roller blades?). My friends and I would be playing in some random parking lot and undoubtedly one of us would be just blowing it the whole game. This would usually lead to an impromptu intervention where the person screwing up (often me) would be told by everyone else on the team to &amp;ldquo;drop the stick&amp;rdquo;.</description>

 This is 100% true of my work email and I have to say, because of the way those emails are organized - as conversations rather than a prioritized, organized to-do list - I end up missing really important things or getting to them too late.</description>

In particular, HP bought Autonomy, a British data analysis company, for about $11 billion. (By the way, can anyone tell me if it&amp;rsquo;s still called Hewlett-Packard, or is it just &amp;ldquo;HP&amp;rdquo;, like &amp;ldquo;AT&amp;amp;T&amp;rdquo;?) From an article a year ago
 Autonomy, with headquarters in Cambridge, England, helps companies and governments store, process, search and analyze large electronic data sets.</description>

      <description>I just was doing my morning reading of a few news sources and stumbled across this Huffington Post article talking about research correlating babies cries to autism. It suggests that the sound of a babies cries may predict their future risk for autism. As the parent of a young son, this obviously caught my attention in a very lizard-brain, caveman sort of way. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t find a link to the research paper in the article so I did some searching and found out this result is also being covered by Time, Science Daily, Medical Daily, and a bunch of other news outlets.</description>

      <title>I give up, I am embracing pie charts</title>

      <description>Most statisticians know that pie charts are a terrible way to plot percentages. You can find explanations here, here, and here as well as the R help file for the pie function which states:
 Pie charts are a very bad way of displaying information. The eye is good at judging linear measures and bad at judging relative areas. A bar chart or dot chart is a preferable way of displaying this type of data.</description>

      <description>Depending on where you land in the political spectrum you may either love or despise Fox News. But regardless of your political affiliation, you have to recognize that their statisticians are well-trained in the art of using graphics to persuade folks of a particular viewpoint. I&amp;rsquo;m not the first to recognize that the graphics department uses some clever tricks to make certain points. But when flipping through the graphs I thought it was interesting to highlight some of the techniques they use to persuade.</description>

      <description>My wife used to teach at Grinnell College, so we were psyched to see that a Grinnell player set the NCAA record for most points in a game. We used to go to the games, which were amazing to watch, when we lived in Iowa. The system the coach has in place there is a ton of fun to watch and is based on statistics! Someone has to vet the science writers at the Huffpo.</description>

      <description>This article in the New York Times today describes some of the advances that computer scientists have made in recent years.
 The technology, called deep learning, has already been put to use in services like Apple’s Siri virtual personal assistant, which is based on Nuance Communications’ speech recognition service, and in Google’s Street View, which uses machine vision to identify specific addresses.
But what is new in recent months is the growing speed and accuracy of deep-learning programs, often called artificial neural networks or just “neural nets” for their resemblance to the neural connections in the brain.</description>

      <description>Mike Bostock talks about the design and construction of the &amp;ldquo;512 Paths to the White House&amp;rdquo; visualization for the New York Times. I found this visualization extremely useful on election night as it helped me understand the implications of each of the swing state calls as the night rolled on.
Regarding the use of outside information to annotate the graphic:
 Applying background knowledge to give the data greater context—such as the influence of the auto-industry bailout on Ohio’s economy—makes the visualization that much richer.</description>

      <description>Among all the young scientists I know, I think Ethan Perlstein is one of the most innovative in the way he has adapted to the internet era. His website is incredibly unique among academic websites, he is all over the social media and his latest experiment in crowd-funding his research is something I&amp;rsquo;m definitely keeping an eye on.
The basic idea is that he has identified a project (giving meth to yeast mouse brains -see the comment by Ethan below-, I think) and put it up on Rockethub, which is a crowd funding platform.</description>

      <description>Welcome to the re-designed, re-hosted and re-platformed Simply Statistics blog. We have moved the blog over to the WordPress platform to give us some newer features that were lacking over at tumblr. So far the transition has gone okay but there may be a few bumps over the next 24 hours or so as we learn the platform. Remember, we&amp;rsquo;re not the young hackers that we used to be.
A few things have changed.</description>

      <description>An interview with Brad Efron about scientific writing. I haven&amp;#8217;t watched the whole interview, but I do know that Efron is one of my favorite writers among statisticians. Slidify, another approach for making HTML5 slides directly from R. I love the idea of making HTML slides, I would definitely do this regularly. But there are a couple of issues I feel still aren&amp;#8217;t resolved: (1) It is still just a little too hard to change the theme/feel of the slides in my opinion.</description>

      <description>Last night this article by Chris Drummond of the Canadian National Research Council (Conseil national de recherches Canada) popped up in my Google Scholar alert. The title of the article, “Reproducible Research: a Dissenting Opinion” would seem to indicate that he disagrees with much that has been circulating out there about reproducible research.
Drummond singles out the Declaration published by a Yale Law School Roundtable on Data and Code Sharing (I was not part of the roundtable) as an example of the main arguments in favor of reproducibility and has four main objections.</description>

      <description>The night of the presidential elections I wrote a post celebrating the victory of data over punditry. I was motivated by the personal attacks made against Nate Silver by pundits that do not understand Statistics. The post generated a little bit of (justified) _nerdrage _(see comment section). So here I clarify a couple of things not as a member of Nate Silver&amp;#8217;s fan club (my mancrush started with PECOTA not fivethirtyeight) but as an applied statistician.</description>

      <description>My favorite statistician did it again! Just like in 2008, he predicted the presidential election results almost perfectly. For those that don&amp;#8217;t know, Nate Silver is the statistician that runs the fivethirtyeight blog. He combines data from hundreds of polls, uses historical data to weigh them appropriately and then uses a statistical model to run simulations and predict outcomes.
While the pundits were claiming the race was a &amp;#8220;dead heat&amp;#8221;, the day before the election Nate gave Obama a 90% chance of winning.</description>

      <description>When I talk about collaborative work, I don&amp;#8217;t mean spending a day or two helping compute some p-values and end up as middle author in a subject-matter paper. I mean spending months working on a project, from start to finish, with experts from other disciplines to accomplish a goal that can only be accomplished with a diverse team. Many papers in genomics are like this (the ENOCDE and 1000 genomes papers for example).</description>

      <description>Brian Caffo headlines the WaPo article about massive online open courses. He is the driving force behind our department&amp;#8217;s involvement in offering these massive courses. I think this sums it up: `“I can’t use another word than unbelievable,” Caffo said. Then he found some more: “Crazy . . . surreal . . . heartwarming.”&amp;#8217; A really interesting discussion of why &amp;#8220;A Bet is a Tax on B.S.&amp;#8221;. It nicely describes why intelligent betters must be disinterested in the outcome, otherwise they will end up losing money.</description>

      <description>As you know, we have a thing for statistical literacy here at Simply Stats. So of course this column over at Politico got our attention (via Chris V. and others). The column is an attack on Nate Silver, who has a blog where he tries to predict the outcome of elections in the U.S., you may have heard of it&amp;#8230;
The argument that Dylan Byers makes in the Politico column is that Nate Silver is likely to be embarrassed by the outcome of the election if Romney wins.</description>

      <description>An important article about anti-science sentiment in the U.S. (via David S.). The politicization of scientific issues such as global warming, evolution, and healthcare (think vaccination) makes the U.S. less competitive. I think the lack of statistical literacy and training in the U.S. is one of the sources of the problem. People use/skew/mangle statistical analyses and experiments to support their view and without a statistically well trained public, it all looks &amp;#8220;reasonable and scientific&amp;#8221;.</description>

      <description>That has got to be the best reason to stay in academia. The meetings where it is just you and a bunch of really smart people thinking about tackling a new project, coming up with cool ideas, and dreaming about how you can really change the way the world works are so much fun.
There is no part of a research job that is better as far as I&amp;#8217;m concerned. It is always downhill after that, you start running into pebbles, your code doesn&amp;#8217;t work, or your paper gets rejected.</description>

      <description>Have you ever met a statistician that enjoys the joint statistical meetings (JSM)? I haven&amp;#8217;t. With the exception of the one night we catch up with old friends there are few positive things we can say about JSM.They are way too big and the two talks I want to see are always somehow scheduled at the same time as mine.
But statisticians actually like conferences. Most of us have a favorite statistics conference, or session within a bigger subject matter conference, that we look forward to going to.</description>

      <description>We all know that politicians can play it a little fast and loose with the truth. This is particularly true in debates, where politicians have to think on their feet and respond to questions from the audience or from each other. Usually, we find out about how truthful politicians are in the &amp;#8220;post-game show&amp;#8221;. The discussion of the veracity of the claims is usually based on independent fact checkers such as PolitiFact.</description>

      <description>This is scientific variant on the #whatshouldwecallme meme isn&amp;#8217;t exclusive to statistics, but it is hilarious.  This is a really interesting post that is a follow-up to the XKCD password security comic. The thing I find most interesting about this is that researchers realized the key problem with passwords was that we were looking at them purely from a computer science perspective. But _people _use passwords, so we need a person-focused approach to maximize security.</description>

      <description>Mathgen, the web site that can produce randomly generated mathematics papers has apparently gotten a paper accepted in a peer-reviewed journal (although perhaps not the most reputable one). I am not at all surprised this happened, but it&amp;#8217;s fun to read both the paper and the reviewer&amp;#8217;s comments. (Thanks to Kasper H. for the pointer.)</description>

      <description>There was a story a few weeks ago on NPR about how Medicare will begin fining hospitals that have 30-day readmission rates that are too high. This process was introduced in the Affordable Care Act and
 Under the health care law, the penalties gradually will rise until 3 percent of Medicare payments to hospitals are at risk. Medicare is considering holding hospitals accountable on four more measures: joint replacements, stenting, heart bypass and treatment of stroke.</description>

      <description>Amanda Palmer broke Twitter yesterday with her insurance poll. She started off just talking about how hard it is for musicians who rarely have health insurance, but then wandered into polling territory. She sent out a request for people to respond with the following information:
 quick twitter poll. 1) COUNTRY?! 2) profession? 3) insured? 4) if not, why not, if so, at what cost per month (or covered by job)?</description>

      <description>A fascinating article about the debate on whether to regulate sugary beverages. One of the protagonists is David Allison, a statistical geneticist, among other things. It is fascinating to see the interplay of statistical analysis and public policy. Yet another example of how statistics/data will drive some of the most important policy decisions going forward.  A related article is this one on the way risk is reported in the media.</description>

      <description>_Editor&amp;#8217;s Note: I recently posted about a paper in Nature that purported to predict the H-index. The authors contacted me to get my criticisms, then responded to those criticisms. They have requested the opportunity to respond publicly, and I think it is a totally reasonable request. Until there is a better comment generating mechanism at the journal level, this seems like as good a forum as any to discuss statistical papers.</description>

      <description>Several bloggers are calling for the end of peer-reviewed journals as we know them. Jeff suggestthat we replace them with a system in which everyone posts their papers on their blog, pubmed aggregates the feeds, and peer-review happens post publication via, for example, counting up like and dislike votes. In my view, many of these critiques seem to conflate problems from different aspects of the process. Here I try to break down the current system into its key components and defend the one aspect I think we should preserve (at least for now): pre-publication peer-review.</description>

      <description>Jack Welch got a little conspiracy-theory crazy with the job numbers. Thomas Lumley over at StatsChat makes a pretty good case for debunking the theory. I think the real take home message of Thomas&amp;#8217; post and one worth celebrating/highlighting is that agencies that produce the jobs report do so based on a fixed and well-defined study design. Careful efforts by government statistics agencies make it hard to fudge/change the numbers.</description>

      <description>A little while ago I wrote a post on statistics projects ideas for students. In honor of the first Simply Statistics Coursera offering, Computing for Data Analysis, here is a new list of student projects for folks excited about trying out those new R programming skills. Again we have rated each project with my best guess difficulty and effort required. Happy computing!

      <description>Nate Silver, everyone&amp;#8217;s favorite statistician made good, just gave an interview where he said he thinks many journal articles should be blog posts. I have been thinking about this same issue for a while now, and I&amp;#8217;m not the only one. This is a really interesting post suggesting that although scientific journals once facilitated dissemination of ideas, they now impede the flow of information and make it more expensive. Two recent examples really drove this message home for me.</description>

      <description>The paper is a review of how to do software development for academics. I saw it via C. Titus Brown (who we have interviewed), he is also a co-author. How to write software (particularly for other people) is something that is under emphasized in many curricula. But it turns out this is also one of the more important components of disseminating your work in modern applied statistics. My only wish is that there was an accompanying website with resources/links for people to chase down.</description>

      <description>The order of authors on scientific papers matters a lot. The best places to be on a paper vary by field. But typically the first and the corresponding (usually last) authors are the prime real estate. When people are evaluated on the job market, for promotion, or to get grants, the number of first/corresponding author papers can be the difference between success and failure. At the same time, many journals list &amp;#8220;authors contributions&amp;#8221; at the end of the manuscript, but this is rarely prominently displayed.</description>

      <description>Good friend and friend of the blog Rob Gould has started a statistics blog called Citizen Statistician. What is a citizen statistician, you ask?
 What is a citizen statistician? A citizen statistician participates in formal and informal data gathering. A citizen statistician is aware of his or her data trail, and is aware of the harm that could be done to themselves or to others through data aggregation. Citizen statisticians recognize opportunities to improve their personal or professional lives through analyzing data, and know how to share data with others.</description>

So we would like to announce a contest to create our new logo. Here are the rules:
 All submissions must be sent to Roger with the email subject, &amp;#8220;Simply Statistics Logo Contest&amp;#8221; The logo must be generated with reproducible R code.</description>

      <description>This is part of the ongoing series of pro tips for graduate students, check out parts one and two for the original installments.  Learn how to write papers in a very clear and simple style. Whenever you can write in plain English, skip jargon as much as possible, and make the approach you are using understandable and clear. This can (sometimes) make it harder to get your papers into journals.</description>

There&amp;#8217;s still plenty of time to register if you are interested in learning about R and the activity on the discussion forums is already quite vibrant.
Also starting today is my colleague Brian Caffo&amp;#8217;s Mathematical Biostatistics Bootcamp, which I hear also has had an energetic start. With any luck, the students in that class may get to see Brian dressed in military fatigues.</description>

      <description>Harvard Business school is getting in on the fun, calling the data scientist the sexy profession for the 21st century. Although I am a little worried that by the time it gets into a Harvard Business document, the hype may be outstripping the real promise of the discipline. Still, good news for statisticians! (via Rafa via Francesca D.&amp;#8217;s Facebook feed).  The counterpoint is this article which suggests that data scientists might be able to be replaced by tools/software.</description>

It is also a pretty flawed data analysis&amp;#8230;so this weeks prediction contest is to identify why the statistics in this paper are so flawed. In my first pass read I noticed about 5 major flaws.

You have to start with a problem you are solving for people and then work your way back. This reminds me a lot of Type B problems in data science/statistics. We have a pile of data, so we don&amp;#8217;t need to have a problem to solve, it will come to us later.</description>

      <description>There has been a lot of discussion lately about whether to be in academia or industry. Some of it I think is a bit unfair to academia. Then I saw this post on Quora asking what Hilary Mason&amp;#8217;s contributions were to machine learning, like she hadn&amp;#8217;t done anything. It struck me as a bit of academia hating on industry*. I don&amp;#8217;t see why one has to be better/worse than the other, as Roger points out, there is no perfect job and it just depends on what you want to do.</description>

      <description>There has been a lot of talk about the Michael Lewis (of Moneyball fame) profile of Obama in Vanity fair. One interesting quote I think deserves a lot more discussion is: &amp;#8220;On top of all of this, after you have made your decision, you need to feign total certainty about it. People being led do not want to think probabilistically.&amp;#8221; This is a key issue that is only going to get worse going forward.</description>

      <description>There&amp;#8217;s a hubbub brewing over a recent study published in the Annals of Internal Medicine that compares organic food (as in &amp;#8216;USDA Organic&amp;#8217;) to non-organic food. The study, titled &amp;#8220;Are Organic Foods Safer or Healthier Than Conventional Alternatives?: A Systematic Review&amp;#8221; is a meta-analysis of about 200 previous studies. Their conclusion, which I have cut-and-pasted below, is
 The published literature lacks strong evidence that organic foods are significantly more nutritious than conventional foods.</description>

      <description>In a recent conversation with Brian (of abstraction fame) about the relationship between mathematics and statistics. Statistics, for historical reasons, has been treated as a mathematical sub-discipline (this is the NSF&amp;#8217;s view).
One reason statistics is viewed as a sub-discipline of math is because the foundations of statistics are built on the basis of deductive reasoning, where you start with a few general propositions or foundations that you assume to be true and then systematically prove more specific results.</description>

      <description>I have just been awarded a certificate for successful completion of the Conflict of Interest Commitment training (I barely passed). Lately, I have been totally swamped by administrative duties and have had little time for actual research. The experience reminded me of something I read in this NYTimes article by Tyler Cowen
 Michael Mandel, an economist with the Progressive Policy Institute, compares government regulation of innovation to the accumulation of pebbles in a stream.</description>

      <description>Not necessarily statistics related, but pretty appropriate now that the school year is starting. Here is a little introduction to &amp;#8220;how to google&amp;#8221; (via Andrew J.). Being able to &amp;#8220;just google it&amp;#8221; and find answers for oneself without having to resort to asking folks is maybe the #1 most useful skill as a statistician.  A really nice presentation on interactive graphics with the googleVis package. I think one of the most interesting things about the presentation is that it was built with markdown/knitr/slidy (see slide 53).</description>

      <description>In our most recent video, Steven Salzberg discusses the ENCODE project. Some of the advantages and disadvantages of top-down science are described. Here, top-down refers to big coordinated projects like the Human Genome Project (HGP). In contrast, the approach of funding many small independent projects, via the R01 mechanism, is referred to as bottom-up. Note that for the cost of HGP we could have funded thousands of R01s. However it is not clear that without the HGP we would have had public sequence data as early as we did.</description>

      <description>Interview with Steven Salzberg about the ENCODE Project.
In this episode Jeff and I have a discussion with Steven Salzberg, Professor of Medicine and Biostatistics at Johns Hopkins University, about the recent findings from the ENCODE Project where he helps us separate fact from fiction. You’re going to want to watch to the end with this one.
Here are some excerpts from the interview.
Regarding why the data should have been released immediately without restriction:</description>

      <description>In this episode of the Simply Statistics podcast Jeff and I discuss the deterministic statistical machine and increasing the cost of data analysis. We decided to eschew the studio setup this time and attempt a more guerilla style of podcasting. Also, Rafa was nowhere to be found when we recorded so you’ll have to catch his melodious singing voice in the next episode.
And in case you’re wondering, Jeff’s office is in fact that clean.</description>

So the question is: How long should our next podcast be?
By the way, Rafa, Jeff, and I all appreciate the little bump over at the 15 minute mark. However, you&amp;#8217;re only encouraging us there!</description>

      <description>Just got back from IBC 2012 in Kobe Japan. I was in an awesome session (organized by the inimitable Lieven Clement) with great talks by Matt McCall, Djork-Arne Clevert, Adetayo Kasim, and Willem Talloen. Willem&amp;#8217;s talk nicely tied in our work and how it plays into the pharmaceutical development process and the bigger theme of big data. On the way home through SFO I saw this hanging in the airport.</description>

      <description>Jeff&amp;#8217;s post about the deterministic statistical machine got me thinking a bit about the cost of data analysis. The cost of data analysis these day is in many ways going up. The data being collected are getting bigger and more complex. Analyzing these data require more expertise, more storage hardware, and more computing power. In fact the analysis in some fields like genomics is now more expensive than the collection of the data [There&amp;#8217;s a graph that shows this but I can&amp;#8217;t seem to find it anywhere; I&amp;#8217;ll keep looking and post later.</description>

      <description>As Roger pointed out the most recent batch of Y Combinator startups included a bunch of data-focused companies. One of these companies, StatWing, is a web-based tool for data analysis that looks like an improvement on SPSS with more plain text, more visualization, and a lot of the technical statistical details &amp;#8220;under the hood&amp;#8221;. I first read about StatWing on TechCrunch, where the title, &amp;#8220;How Statwing Makes It Easier To Ask Questions About Data So You Don’t Have To Hire a Statistical Wizard&amp;#8221;.</description>

 Unbelievably the BRCA gene patents were upheld by the lower court despite the Supreme Court coming down pretty unequivocally against patenting correlations between metabolites and health outcomes.

      <description>Simply Statistics Podcast #1.
To mark the occasion of our 1-year anniversary of starting the blog, Jeff, Rafa, and I have recorded our first podcast. You can tell that it’s our very first podcast because we don’t appear to have any idea what we’re doing. However, we decided to throw caution to the wind.
In this episode we talk about why we started the blog and discuss our thoughts on statistics and big data.</description>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;ve fallen behind and so haven&amp;#8217;t had a chance to mention this, but Science Exchange has started its Reproducibility Initiative. The idea is that authors can submit their study to be reproduced and Science Exchange will match the study with a validator who will attempt to reproduce the results (for a fee).
 Validated studies will receive a Certificate of Reproducibility acknowledging that their results have been independently reproduced as part of the Reproducibility Initiative.</description>

Back in October 2011, Sastry Pantula, the Director of the Division of Mathematical Sciences at NSF (formerly the Chair of NC State Statistics Department and President of the ASA), proposed that the name of the Division be changed to the &amp;#8220;Division of Mathematical and Statistical Sciences&amp;#8221;. Excerpting from his original proposal, Pantula says

      <description>Statisticians have not always been great self-promoters. I think in part this comes from our tendency to be arbiters rather than being involved in the scientific process. In some ways, I think this is a good thing. Self-promotion can quickly become really annoying. On the other hand, I think our advertising shortcomings are hurting our field in a number of different ways. Here are a few:

      <description>An interesting blog post about the top N reasons to do a Ph.D. in bioinformatics or computational biology. A couple of things that I find interesting and could actually be said of any program in biostatistics as well are: computing is the key skill of the 21st century and computational skills are highly transferrable. Via Andrew J.  Here is an interesting auto-complete map of the United States where the prompt was, &amp;#8220;Why is [state] so&amp;#8221;.</description>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;m a relatively new dad. Before the kid we affectionately call the &amp;#8220;tiny tornado&amp;#8221; (TT) came into my life, I had relatively little experience dealing with babies and all the fluids they emit. So admittedly, I was a little squeamish dealing with the poopy explosions the TT would create. Inevitably, things would get much more messy than they had to be while I was being too delicate with the issue. It took me an embarrassingly long time for an educated man, but I finally realized you just have to get in there and change the thing even if it is messy, then wash your hands after.</description>

      <description>Editor&amp;#8217;s Note: This post written by Roger Peng and Jeff Leek.  A couple of weeks ago, we announced that we would be teaching free courses in Computing for Data Analysis and Data Analysis on the Coursera platform. At the same time, a number of other universities also announced partnerships with Coursera leading to a large number of new offerings. That, coupled with a new round of funding for Coursera, led to press coverage in the New York Times, the Atlantic, and other media outlets.</description>

      <description>A few years ago I stumbled across a blog post that described a person&amp;#8217;s complete cv. The idea was that the cv listed both the things they had accomplished and the things they had failed to accomplish. At the time, it really helped me to see that to be successful you have to be willing to fail over and over. I use my website to show the things I have accomplished career-wise.</description>

      <title>On the relative importance of mathematical abstraction in graduate statistical education</title>

      <description>_Editor’s Note: This is the counterpoint in our series of posts on the value of abstraction in graduate education. See Brian’s defense of abstraction on Monday and the comments on his post, as well as the comments on our original teaser post for more. See below for a full description of the T-bone inside joke*._**
Brian did a good job at defining abstraction. In a cagey debater’s move, he provided an incredibly broad definition of abstraction that includes the reason we call a a smiley face, the reason why we can apply least squares to a variety of data types, and the reason we write functions when programming.</description>

Brian Caffo, recently installed Graduate Program Director at the best Biostat department in the country, has kindly agreed to lead off with the case for abstraction. We&amp;#8217;ll follow up later in the week with my counterpoint. In the meantime, there have already been a number of really interesting and insightful comments inspired by our teaser post that are well worth reading.</description>

      <description>At JSM this year we learned that Samuel Kou of Harvard&amp;#8217;s Department of Statistics won the Committee of Presidents of Statistical Societies (COPSS) President&amp;#8217;s award. The award is given annually to
 a young member of the statistical community in recognition of an outstanding contribution to the profession of statistics. The recipient of the Presidents&amp;#8217; Award must be a member of at least one of the participating societies. The candidate may be chosen for a single contribution of extraordinary merit, or an outstanding aggregate of contributions, to the profession of statistics.</description>

By my last count I think I&amp;#8217;ve seen three from computer science professors leaving academia for Google. The most recent one being from Terran Lane at University of New Mexico. At this point, Google should just start a recruiting office in middle of all the CS departments around the country. I think they&amp;#8217;d get some good people.</description>

      <description>A recent lunchtime discussion here at Hopkins brought up the somewhat-controversial topic of abstract thinking in our graduate program. We, like a lot of other biostatistics/statistics programs, require our students to take measure theoretic probability as part of the curriculum. The discussion started as a conversation about whether we should require measure theoretic probability for our students. It evolved into a discussion of the value of abstract thinking (and whether measure theoretic probability was a good tool to measure abstract thinking).</description>

      <description>Many academics are complaining about online education and warning us about how it can lead to a lower quality product. For example, the New York Times recently published this op-ed piece wondering if &amp;#8220;online education [will] ever be education of the very best sort?&amp;#8221;. Although pretty much every controlled experiment comparing online and in-class education finds that students learn just about the same under both approaches, I do agree that in-person lectures are more enjoyable to both faculty and students.</description>

      <description>I noticed in the development version of R the following note in the NEWS file:
 There is a subtle change in behaviour for numeric index values 2^31 and larger. These used never to be legitimate and so were treated as NA, sometimes with a warning. They are now legal for long vectors so there is no longer a warning, and x[2^31] &amp;lt;- y will now extend the vector on a 64-bit platform and give an error on a 32-bit one.</description>

      <description>In math or statistics, proof by example does not work. One example of a phenomenon does not prove anything. For example, because 2 is prime doesn&amp;#8217;t mean that all even numbers are prime. In fact, no even numbers other than 2 are prime. But in other areas proof by example is the best way to demonstrate something. One example is writing letters of recommendation. It is way more convincing when I get one example of something a person has achieved:</description>

      <description>Facebook&amp;#8217;s first quarterly earnings report as a public company is coming out this Thursday and everyone&amp;#8217;s wondering what will be in it. One question is whether advertisers are going to Facebook over other sites like Google.
 “Advertisers need more proof that actual advertising on Facebook offers a return on investment,” said Debra Aho Williamson, an analyst with the market research firm eMarketer. “There is such disagreement over whether Facebook is the next big thing on the Internet or whether it’s going to fail miserably.</description>

      <description>This paper is the paper describing how Uri Simonsohn identified academic misconduct using statistical analyses. This approach has received a huge amount of press in the scientific literature. The basic approach is that he calculates the standard deviations of mean/standard deviation estimates across groups being compared. Then he simulates from a Normal distribution and shows that under the Normal model, it is unlikely that the means/standard deviations are so similar.</description>

      <description>Lauren Talbot   
Lauren Talbot is a quantitative analyst for the New York City Financial Crime Task Force. Before working for NYC she was an analyst at Acumen LLC and got her degree in economics from Stanford University. She is a key player turning spatial data in NYC into new tools for government management. We talked to Lauren about her work, how she is using open data to do things like predict where fires might occur, and how she got started in the Financial Crime Task Force.</description>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;m about to head out for JSM in a couple of weeks. The sheer magnitude of the conference means it is pretty hard to figure out what talks I should attend. One approach I&amp;#8217;ve used in the past is to identify people who I know give good talks and go to their talks. But that isn&amp;#8217;t a very good talk-discovery mechanism. So this year I&amp;#8217;m trying a crowd-sourcing experiment. First, some background on what kind of talks I like.</description>

      <description>The US News best hospital 2012-20132 rankings are out. The big news is that Johns Hopkins has lost its throne. For 21 consecutive years Hopkins was ranked #1, but this year Mass General Hospital (MGH) took the top spot displacing Hopkins to #2. However, Elisabet Pujadas, an MD-PhD student here at Hopkins, took a close look at the data used for the rankings and made this plot (by hand!). The plot shows histograms of the rankings by speciality and shows Hopkins outperforming MGH.</description>

      <description>A really nice list of journals software/data release policies from Titus&amp;#8217; blog. Interesting that he couldn&amp;#8217;t find a data/release policy for the New England Journal of Medicine. I wonder if that is because it publishes mostly clinical studies, where the data are often protected for privacy reasons? It seems like there is going to eventually be a big discussion of the relative importance of privacy and open data in the clinical world.</description>

Best line: &amp;#8220;Should I wait for the next version of Emacs? Hell no!&amp;#8221;

      <description>These days, like most people, the research I do involves writing a lot of code. A lot of it. Usually, you need some code to
 Process the data to take it from its original format to the format that&amp;#8217;s convenient for you Run exploratory data analyses creating plots, calculating summary statistics, etc. Try statistical model 1 Try statistical model 2 Try statistical model 3 &amp;#8230; Fit final statistical model; if this involves MCMC then there&amp;#8217;s usually a ton of code to do this Make some more plots of results, make tables, more summary statistics of output  My question is, of all this code, which is the most important?</description>

      <description>My colleagues and I just published a paper on validation of genomic results in BMC Bioinformatics. It is &amp;#8220;highly accessed&amp;#8221; and we are really happy with how it turned out. But it was brutal getting it published. Here is the line-up of places I sent the paper.  Science: Submitted 10/6/10, rejected 10/18/10 without review. I know this seems like a long shot, but this paper on validation was published in Science not too long after.</description>

I&amp;#8217;ve been out of power in my house since last Friday and projections are it won&amp;#8217;t come back until the end of the week. I am lucky because my family and I have some backup options, but not everyone has those options.
So that leads me to this question&amp;#8212;do power outages affect health?</description>

      <description>The psychology/social psychology community has made replication a huge focus over the last year. One reason is the recent, public blow-up over a famous study that did not replicate. There are also concerns about the experimental and conceptual design of these studies that go beyond simple lack of replication. In genomics, a similar scandal occurred due to what amounted to &amp;#8220;data fudging&amp;#8221;. Although, in the genomics case, much of the blame and focus has been on lack of reproducibility or data availability.</description>

This was a novel experience for me given that I was the only non-computer scientist on the committee. That said, I think the report is quite interesting for a number of reasons. As a statistician, I took away a few lessons.</description>

      <description>Obamacare may help protect a vulnerable section of our population, but it does nothing to solve the real problem with health care in the US: it is unsustainably expensive and getting worst worse. In the graph below (left) per capita medical expenditures for several countries are plotted against time. The US is the black curve, other countries are in grey. On the right we see life expectancy plotted against per capita medical expenditure.</description>

      <description>It seems like half of the battle in statistics is identifying an important/unsolved problem. In math, this is easy, they have a list. So why is it harder for statistics? Since I have to think up projects to work on for my research group, for classes I teach, and for exams we give, I have spent some time thinking about ways that research problems in statistics arise.
I borrowed a page out of Roger&amp;#8217;s book and made a little diagram to illustrate my ideas (actually I can&amp;#8217;t even claim credit, it was Roger&amp;#8217;s idea to make the diagram).</description>

      <description>I agree with Roger&amp;#8217;s latest post: &amp;#8220;we need to expand the tent of statistics and include people who are using their statistical training to lead the new science&amp;#8221;. I am perhaps a bit more worried than Roger. Specifically, I worry that talented go-getters interested in leading science via data analysis will achieve this without engaging our research community. A quantitatively trained person (engineers , computer scientists, physicists, etc..) with strong computing skills (knows python, C, and shell scripting), that reads, for example, &amp;#8220;Elements of Statistical Learning&amp;#8221; and learns R, is well on their way.</description>

      <description>There&amp;#8217;s lots of talk about &amp;#8220;big data&amp;#8221; these days and I think that&amp;#8217;s great. I think it&amp;#8217;s bringing statistics out into the mainstream (even if they don&amp;#8217;t call it statistics) and it creating lots of opportunities for people with statistics training. It&amp;#8217;s one of the reasons we created this blog.
One thing that I think gets missed in much of the mainstream reporting is that, in my opinion, the biggest problems aren&amp;#8217;t with the truly massive datasets out there that need to be mined for important information.</description>

      <description>A recent article by a former Obama administration official has stirred up debate over the obstacles women face in balancing work/life. This reminded me of this report written by a committee here at Hopkins to help resolve the current gender-based career obstacles for women faculty. The report is great, but in practice we have a long way to go. For example, my department has not hired a woman at the tenure track level in 15 years.</description>

      <description>We&amp;#8217;ve got a new domain! You can still follow us on tumblr or here: http://simplystatistics.org/.  A cool article on MIT&amp;#8217;s annual sports statistics conference (via @storeylab). I love how the guy they chose to highlight created what I would consider a pretty simple visualization with known tools - but it turns out it is potentially a really new way of evaluating the shooting range of basketball players. This is my favorite kind of creativity in statistics.</description>

      <description>One of my favorite movies is Woody Allen&amp;#8217;s Annie Hall. If you&amp;#8217;re my age and you haven&amp;#8217;t seen it, I usually tell people it&amp;#8217;s like When Harry Met Sally, except really good. The movie opens with Woody Allen&amp;#8217;s character Alvy Singer explaining that he would &amp;#8220;never want to belong to any club that would have someone like me for a member&amp;#8221;, a quotation he attributes to Groucho Marx (or Freud).</description>

      <description>This is the second in my series on pro tips for graduate students in statistics/biostatistics. For more tips, see part 1.  Meet with seminar speakers. When you go on the job market face recognition is priceless. I met Scott Zeger at UW when I was a student. When I came for an interview I already knew him (and Ingo, and Rafa, and &amp;#8230;.). An even better idea&amp;#8230;ask a question during the seminar.</description>

      <description>I just finished teaching a Ph.D. level applied statistical methods course here at Hopkins. As part of the course, I gave one &amp;#8220;pro-tip&amp;#8221; a day; something I wish I had learned in graduate school that has helped me in becoming a practicing applied statistician. Here are the first three, more to come soon.   A major component of being a researcher is knowing what&amp;#8217;s going on in the research community.</description>

      <description>Happy Father&amp;#8217;s Day!
 A really interesting read on randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and public policy. The examples in the boxes are fantastic. This seems to be one of the cases where the public policy folks are borrowing ideas from Biostatistics, which has been involved in randomized controlled trials for a long time. It&amp;#8217;s a cool example of adapting good ideas in one discipline to the specific challenges of another.  Roger points to this link in the NY Times about the &amp;#8220;Consumer Genome&amp;#8221;, which basically is a collection of information about your purchases and consumer history.</description>

      <description>Today I got my copy of Amstat News and eagerly opened it before I realized it was not the issue with the salary survey&amp;#8230;.
But the President&amp;#8217;s Corner section had the following column on big data by ASA president Robert Rodriguez.
 Big Data is big news. It is the focus of stories in The New York Times and the subject of technology blogs, business forums, and economic studies. This column describes how statisticians can prepare for opportunities in Big Data and explains the distinctive value our profession can provide.</description>

 The Embassy has received reports from U.S. citizens living and traveling in Wuhan that the air quality in the city has been particularly poor since yesterday morning. On June 11 at 16:20, the Wuhan Environmental Protection Administrative Bureau posted information about this on its website. Below is a translation of that information:</description>

      <description>Y Combinator is company that invests in startups and brings them to the San Francisco area to get them ready for prime time. One of the co-founders is Paul Graham, whose essays we&amp;#8217;ve featured on this blog.
The Y Combinator web site itself is quite interesting and in particular, the section on how to apply to Y Combinator caught my eye. Now, I don&amp;#8217;t know the first thing about starting a startup (nor do I have any current interest in doing so), but I do know a little bit about applying for NIH grants and it struck me that the advice for the startups seemed very useful for writing grants.</description>

Amanda Cox received her M.S. in statistics from the University of Washington in 2005. She then moved to the New York Times, where she is a graphics editor. She, and the graphics team at the New York Times, are responsible for many of the cool, informative, and interactive graphics produced by the Times. For example, this, this and this (the last one, Olympic Symphony, is one of my all time favorites).</description>

      <description>Spurred by Rafa&amp;#8217;s post on evaluating statisticians working in genomics, there&amp;#8217;s an interesting discussion going on at the Scientists for Reproducible Research group on statistics journals. Evan Johnson kicks it off:
 &amp;#8230;our statistics journals have little impact on how genomic data are analyzed. My group rarely looks to publish in statistics journals anymore because even IF we can get it published quickly, NO ONE will read it, so the only things we send there anymore are things that we don&amp;#8217;t care if anyone ever uses.</description>

      <description>This is yet another outstanding post by Paul Graham, this time on &amp;#8220;Schlep Blindness&amp;#8221;. He talks about how there are great startup ideas that no one considers because they are too much of a &amp;#8220;schlep&amp;#8221; (a tedious unpleasant task). He talks about how most founders of startups want to put up a clever bit of code they wrote and just watch the money flow in. But of course it doesn&amp;#8217;t work like that, you need to advertise, interact with customers, raise money, go out and promote your work, fix bugs at 3am, etc.</description>

      <description>Amanda Cox on the process they went through to come up with this graphic about the Facebook IPO. So cool to see how R is used in the development process. A favorite quote of mine, &amp;#8220;But rather than bringing clarity, it just sort of looked chaotic, even to the seasoned chart freaks of 620 8th Avenue.&amp;#8221; One of the more interesting things about posts like this is you get to see how statistics versus a deadline works.</description>

      <title>&#34;How do we evaluate statisticians working in genomics? Why don&#39;t they publish in stats journals?&#34; Here is my answer
</title>

      <guid>/2012/05/24/how-do-we-evaluate-statisticians-working-in-genomics/</guid>
      <description>During the past couple of years I have been asked these questions by several department chairs and other senior statisticians interested in hiring or promoting faculty working in genomics. The main difficulty stems from the fact that we (statisticians working in genomics) publish in journals outside the mainstream statistical journals. This can be a problem during evaluation because a quick-and-dirty approach to evaluating an academic statistician is to count papers in the Annals of Statistics, JASA, JRSS and Biometrics.</description>

      <description>It&amp;#8217;s grant season around here so I&amp;#8217;ll be brief:   I love this article in the WSJ about the crisis at JP Morgan. The key point it highlights is that looking only at the high-level analysis and summaries can be misleading, you have to look at the raw data to see the potential problems. As data become more complex, I think its critical we stay in touch with the raw data, regardless of discipline.</description>

The West Wing was always a favorite show of mine (at least, seasons 1-4, the Sorkin years) and I think this is a great scene which talks about the difference between evidence and interpretation. The topic is a 5-day waiting period for gun purchases and they&amp;#8217;ve just received a poll in a few specific congressional districts showing weak support for this proposed policy.

One of their most recent articles describes how UC Berkeley is getting $60 million dollars for a new computer science center. Meanwhile, at University of Florida the administration seems to be oblivious to all this and about a month ago announced it was dropping its computer science department to save $.</description>

      <description>Hadley Wickham  
    
  
Hadley Wickham is the Dobelman Family Junior Chair of Statistics at Rice University. Prior to moving to Rice, he completed his Ph.D. in Statistics from Iowa State University. He is the developer of the wildly popular ggplot2 software for data visualization and a contributor to the Ggobi project. He has developed a number of really useful R packages touching everything from data processing, to data modeling, to visualization.</description>

      <title>What are the products of data analysis?</title>

      <description>Thanks to everyone for the feedback on my post on knowing when someone is good at data analysis. A couple people suggested I take a look here for a few people who have proven they&amp;#8217;re good at data analysis. I think that&amp;#8217;s a great idea and a good place to start.
But I also think that while demonstrating an ability to build good prediction models is impressive and definitely shows an understanding of the data, not all important problems can be easily posed as prediction problems.</description>

      <description>Consider this exercise. Come up with a list of the top 5 people that you think are really good at data analysis.
There&amp;#8217;s one catch: They have to be people that you&amp;#8217;ve never met nor have had any sort of personal interaction with (e.g. email, chat, etc.). So basically people who have written papers/books you&amp;#8217;ve read or have given talks you&amp;#8217;ve seen or that you know through other publicly available information.</description>

      <description>The very very cool UCLA Data Fest is going on as we speak. This is a statistical analysis marathon where teams of undergrads work through the night (and day) to address an important problem through data analysis. Last year they looked at crime data from the Los Angeles Police Department. I&amp;#8217;m looking forward to seeing how this year goes.
Great work by Rob Gould and the Department of Statistics there.</description>

      <description>Last week I linked to an ad for a Data Editor position at Nature Magazine. I was super excited that Nature was recognizing data as an important growth area. But the ad doesn&amp;#8217;t mention anything about statistical analysis skills; it focuses exclusively on data management expertise. As I pointed out in the earlier post, managing data is only half the equation - figuring out what to do with the data is the other half.</description>

      <description>Nature genetics has an editorial on the Mayo and Myriad cases. I agree with this bit: &amp;#8220;In our opinion, it is not new judgments or legislation that are needed but more innovation. In the era of whole-genome sequencing of highly variable genomes, it is increasingly hard to justify exclusive ownership of particularly useful parts of the genome, and method claims must be more carefully described.&amp;#8221; Via Andrew J.

      <description>I finally got around to reading the IOM report on translational omics and it is very good. The report lays out problems with current practices and how these led to undesired results such as the now infamous Duke trials and the growth in retractions in the scientific literature. Specific recommendations are provided related to reproducibility and validation. I expect the report will improve things. Although I think bigger improvements will come as a result of retirements.</description>

      <description>One of the key things every statistician needs to learn is how to create informative figures and graphs. Sometimes, it is easy to use off-the-shelf plots like barplots, histograms, or if one is truly desperate a pie-chart. But sometimes the information you are trying to communicate requires the development of a new graphic. I am currently working on a project with a graduate student where the standard illustration are Venn Diagrams - including complicated Venn Diagrams with 5 or 10 circles.</description>

      <description>Jeff Leek, Reeves Anderson, and I recently wrote a correspondence to Nature (subscription req.) regarding the Supreme Court decision in Mayo v. Prometheus and the recent Institute of Medicine report related to the Duke Clinical Trials Saga. The basic gist of the correspondence is that the IOM report stresses the need for openness in the process of developing &amp;#8216;omics based tests, but the Court decision suggests that patent protection will not be available to protect those details.</description>

      <description>Now we know who is to blame for the pie chart. I had no idea it had been around, straining our ability to compare relative areas, since 1801. However, the same guy (William Playfair) apparently also invented the bar chart. So he wouldn&amp;#8217;t be totally shunned by statisticians. (via Leonid K.)

      <description>Reproducibility has been a hot topic for the last several years among computational scientists. A study is reproducible if there is a specific set of computational functions/analyses (usually specified in terms of code) that exactly reproduce all of the numbers in a published paper from raw data. It is now recognized that a critical component of the scientific process is that data analyses can be reproduced. This point has been driven home particularly for personalized medicine applications, where irreproducible results can lead to delays in evaluating new procedures that affect patients&amp;#8217; health.</description>

      <description>Statistics depends on math, like a lot of other disciplines (physics, engineering, chemistry, computer science). But just like those other disciplines, statistics is not math; math is just a tool used to solve statistical problems. Unlike those other disciplines, statistics gets lumped in with math in headlines. Whenever people use statistical analysis to solve an interesting problem, the headline reads:

It boils down to one simple question: What is a major revision?</description>

      <description>This is a great article about the illusion of progress in machine learning. In part, I think it explains why the Leekasso (just using the top 10) isn&amp;#8217;t a totally silly idea. I also love how he talks about sources of uncertainty in real prediction problems that aren&amp;#8217;t part of the classical models when developing prediction algorithms. I think that this is a hugely underrated component of building an accurate classifier - just finding the quirks particular to a type of data.</description>

      <description>As Reeves alluded to in his post about the Mayo personalized medicine case, the Supreme Court just vacated the lower court&amp;#8217;s ruling in Association for Molecular Pathology v. Myriad Genetics (No. 11-725). The case has been sent back down to the Federal Circuit for reconsideration in light of the Court&amp;#8217;s decision in Mayo. This means that the Supreme Court thought the two cases were sufficiently similar that the lower courts should take another look using the new direction from Mayo.</description>

      <description>I just read this fascinating post on _why, apparently a bit of a cult hero among enthusiasts of the Ruby programming language. One of the most interesting bits was The Little Coder&amp;#8217;s Predicament, which boiled down essentially says that computer programming languages have grown too complex - so children/newbies can&amp;#8217;t get the instant gratification when they start programming. He suggested a simplified &amp;#8220;gateway language&amp;#8221; that would get kids fired up about programming, because with a simple line of code or two they could make the computer do things like play some music or make a video.</description>

      <description>The psychologist whose experiment didn&amp;#8217;t replicate then went off on the scientists who did the replication experiment is at it again. I don&amp;#8217;t see a clear argument about the facts of the matter in his post, just more name calling. This seems to be a case study in what not to do when your study doesn&amp;#8217;t replicate. More on &amp;#8220;conceptual replication&amp;#8221; in there too.  Berkeley is running a data science course with instructors Jeff Hammerbacher and Mike Franklin, I looked through the notes and it looks pretty amazing.</description>

      <description>Shortly after the Duke trial scandal broke, the Institute of Medicine convened a committee to write a report on translational omics. Several statisticians (including one of our interviewees) either served on the committee or provided key testimony. The report came out yesterday. Nature, Nature Medicine, and Science had posts about the release. Keith Baggerly sent an email with his thoughts and he gave me permission to post it here. He starts by pointing out that the Science piece has a key new observation:</description>

      <description>The NIH provides financial support for a large percentage of biological and medical research in the United States. This funding supports a large number of US jobs, creates new knowledge, and improves healthcare for everyone. So I am signing this petition: 

 NIH funding is essential to our national research enterprise, to our local economies, to the retention and careers of talented and well-educated people, to the survival of our medical educational system, to our rapidly fading worldwide dominance in biomedical research, to job creation and preservation, to national economic viability, and to our national academic infrastructure.</description>

      <description>Some more commentary on Mayo v. Prometheus via the Patently-O blog.
A summary of the various briefs and history of the case can be found at the SCOTUS blog.
Some actual news coverage of the decision.
The decision is well-worth reading, if you’re that kind of nerd. Here, the Court uses the phrase “law of nature” a bit more loosely than perhaps I would use it. On the one hand, something like E=mc^2 might be considered a law of nature, but on the other hand I would consider the observation that certain blood metabolites are correlated with the occurrence of patient side effects as, well, a correlation.</description>

      <description>Just a few minutes ago the Supreme Court released their decision in the Mayo case, see here for the Simply Statistics summary of the case. The court ruled unanimously that the personalized medicine test could not be patented. Such a strong ruling likely has major implications going forward for the field of personalized medicine. At the end of the day, this decision was based on an interpretation of statistical correlation. Stay tuned for a special in-depth analysis in the next couple of days that will get into the details of the ruling and the implications for personalized medicine.</description>

      <description>A really interesting proposal by Rafa (in Spanish - we&amp;#8217;ll get on him to write a translation) for the University of Puerto Rico. The post concerns changing the focus from simply teaching to creating knowledge and the potential benefits to both the university and to Puerto Rico. It also has a really nice summary of the benefits that the university system in the United States has produced. Definitely worth a read.</description>

      <description>I know we need a new journal like we need a good poke in the eye. But I got fired up by the recent discussion of open science (by Paul Krugman and others) and the seriously misguided Research Works Act- that aimed to make it illegal to deposit published papers funded by the government in Pubmed central or other open access databases.
 I also realized that I spend a huge amount of time/effort on the following things: (1) waiting for reviews (typically months), (2) addressing reviewer comments that are unrelated to the accuracy of my work - just adding citations to referees papers or doing additional simulations, and (3) resubmitting rejected papers to new journals - this is a huge time suck since I have to reformat, etc.</description>

      <description>This is the big one. ESPN has opened up access to their API! It looks like there may only be access to some of the data for the general public though, does anyone know more?  Looks like ESPN isn&amp;#8217;t the only sports-related organization in the API mood, Nike plans to open up an API too. It would be great if they had better access to individual, downloadable data.  Via Leonid K.</description>

      <description>There has been some discussion about whether Google Scholar or one of the proprietary software companies numbers are better for citation counts. I personally think Google Scholar is better for a number of reasons:
 Higher numbers, but consistently/adjustably higher  It&amp;#8217;s free and the data are openly available.  It covers more ground (patents, theses, etc.) to give a better idea of global impact It&amp;#8217;s easier to use  I haven&amp;#8217;t seen a plot yet relating Web of Science citations to Google Scholar citations, so I made one for my papers.</description>

      <description>You can now see profiles of famous scientists on Google Scholar citations. Here are links to a few of them (via Ben L.). Von Neumann, Einstein, Newton, Feynman
But their impact on science pales in comparison (with the possible exception of Newton) to the impact of one statistician: R.A. Fisher. Many of the concepts he developed are so common and are considered so standard, that he is never cited/credited. Here are some examples of things he invented along with a conservative number of citations they would have received calculated via Google Scholar*.</description>

I&amp;#8217;m starting to think the fact that I&amp;#8217;m not on Github is a serious dent in my nerd cred.  Datawrapper - a less intensive, but less flexible open source data visualization creator. I have seen a few of these types of services starting to pop up. I think that some statistics training should be mandatory before people use them.</description>

      <description>This is awesome. There are a few places with some strong language, but overall I think the message is pretty powerful. Via Tariq K. I agree with Tariq, one of the gems is:
 If you want to measure something, then don&amp;#8217;t measure other sh**.

      <description>Via AL Daily, this dude collects data and analyzes it to put war criminals away. The idea of using statistics to quantify mass testimony is interesting.  With statistical methods and the right kind of data, he can make what we know tell us what we don&amp;#8217;t know. He has shown human rights groups, truth commissions, and international courts how to take a collection of thousands of testimonies and extract from them the magnitude and pattern of violence &amp;#8212; to lift the fog of war.</description>

      <description>Here are a few ideas that might make for interesting student projects at all levels (from high-school to graduate school). I&amp;#8217;d welcome ideas/suggestions/additions to the list as well. All of these ideas depend on free or scraped data, which means that anyone can work on them. I&amp;#8217;ve given a ballpark difficulty for each project to give people some idea.
Happy data crunching!

      <description>A few of our recent posts relate to the Duke trial saga. For those that want to learn more, Baggerly and Coombes have put together a &amp;#8220;starter set&amp;#8221;. It includes

      <description>The last time I posted something about finance I got schooled by people who actually know stuff. So let me just say that I don&amp;#8217;t claim to be an expert in this area, but I do have an interest in it and try to keep up the best I can.
One book I picked up a little while ago was _Security Analysis_ by Benjamin Graham and David Dodd. This is the &amp;#8220;bible of value investing&amp;#8221; and so I mostly wanted to see what all the hubbub was about.</description>

      <description>One incredibly popular tool for the analysis of high-dimensional data is the lasso. The lasso is commonly used in cases when you have many more predictors than independent samples (the n &amp;#171;&amp;#160;p) problem. It is also often used in the context of prediction.
Suppose you have an outcome Y and several predictors X1,&amp;#8230;,XM, the lasso fits a model:
Y = B + B1 X1 + B2 X2 + &amp;#8230; + BM XM + E</description>

      <description>A week ago, Nate Silver tweeted this:
 Since Lin became starting PG, Knicks have outscored opponents by 63 with Novak on the floor. Been outscored by 8 when he isn&amp;#8217;t.
 In a previous post we showed the plot below. Note that Carmelo Anthony is in ball hog territory. Novak plays the same position as Anthony but is a three point specialist. His career three point FG% of 42% (253-603) puts him 10th all time!</description>

      <description>An awesome alternative to D3.js - R&amp;#8217;s svgAnnotation package. Here&amp;#8217;s the paper in JSS. I feel like this is one step away from gaining broad use in the statistics community - it still feels a little complicated building the graphics, but there is plenty of flexibility there. I feel like a great project for a student at any level would be writing some easy wrapper functions for these functions.  How to run R on your Android device.</description>

      <description>Peter Theil gives his take on science funding/peer review:
 My libertarian views are qualified because I do think things worked better in the 1950s and 60s, but it’s an interesting question as to what went wrong with DARPA. It’s not like it has been defunded, so why has DARPA been doing so much less for the economy than it did forty or fifty years ago? Parts of it have become politicized.</description>

      <description>In a previous post I complained about statistics journals taking way too long rejecting papers. Today I am complaining because even when everything goes right &amp;#8212;better than above average review time (for statistics), useful and insightful comments from reviewers&amp;#8212; we can come out losing.
In May 2011 we submitted a paper on removing GC bias from RNAseq data to Biostatistics. It was published on December 27. However, we were scooped by this BMC Bioinformatics paper published ten days earlier despite being submitted three months later and accepted 11 days after ours.</description>

      <description>One factor that is critical for any financial planning is estimating what future inflation will be. For example, if you&amp;#8217;re saving money in an instrument that gains 3% per year, and inflation is estimated to be 4% per year, well then you&amp;#8217;re losing money in real terms.
There are a variety of ways to estimate the rate of future inflation. You could, for example, use past rates as an estimate of future rates.</description>

      <description>In my last post I complained about efficiency not being discussed enough by NBA announcers and commentators. I pointed out that some of the best scorers have relatively low FG% or TS%. However, via the comments it was pointed out that top scorers need to take more difficult shots and thus are expected to have lower efficiency. The plot below (made with this R script) seems to confirm this (click image to enlarge) .</description>

      <title>Cleveland&#39;s (?) 2001 plan for redefining statistics as &#34;data science&#34;

      <description>This plan has been making the rounds on Twitter and is being attributed to William Cleveland in 2001 (thanks to Kasper for the link). I&amp;#8217;m not sure of the provenance of the document but it has some really interesting ideas and is worth reading in its entirety. I actually think that many Biostatistics departments follow the proposed distribution of effort pretty closely. One of the most interesting sections is the discussion of computing (emphasis mine):  Data analysis projects today rely on databases, computer and network hardware, and computer and network software.</description>

      <description>There was recently a fascinating article published in PNAS that compared the sound quality of different types of violins. In this study, researchers assembled a collection of six violins, three of which were made by Stradivari and Guarneri del Gesu and three made by modern luthiers (i.e. 20th century). The combined value of the &amp;#8220;old&amp;#8221; violins was $10 million, about 100 times greater than the combined value of the &amp;#8220;new&amp;#8221; violins.</description>

      <description>I find it surprising that NBA commentators rarely talk about field goal percentage. Everybody knows that the more you shoot the more you score. But players that score a lot are admired without consideration of their FG%. Of course having a high FG% is not necessarily admirable as many players only take easy shots, while top-scorers need to take difficult ones. Regardless, missing is undesirable and players that miss more than usual are not criticized enough.</description>

      <description>A growing tend in education is to put lectures online, for free. The Kahn Academy, Stanford&amp;#8217;s recent AI course, and Gary King&amp;#8217;s new quantitative government course at Harvard are three of the more prominent examples. This new pedagogical format is more democratic, free, and helps people learn at their own pace. It has led some, including us here at Simply Statistics, to suggest that the future of graduate education lies in online courses.</description>

      <description>Like many statisticians, I was amped to see a statistics paper appear in Science. Given the impact that statistics has on the scientific community, it is a shame that more statistics papers don&amp;#8217;t appear in the glossy journals like Science or Nature. As I pointed out in the previous post, if the paper that introduced the p-value was cited every time this statistic was used, the paper would have over 3 million citations!</description>

From the venture capitalist-in-chief, to the javascript coding mayor of New York, everyone is on board. No surprise there, successful startups lead to job creation which can have a major positive impact on the economy. The game has been dominated for a long time by the folks over in CS. But the value of many recent startups is either based on, or can be magnified by, good data analysis.</description>

      <description>The Fundamentals of Engineering Exam is the first licensing exam for engineers. You have to pass it on your way to becoming a professional engineer (PE). I was recently shown a problem from a review manual:  When it is operating properly, a chemical plant has a daily production rate that is normally distributed with a mean of 880 tons/day and a standard deviation of 21 tons/day. During an analysis period, the output is measured with random sampling on 50 consecutive days, and the mean output is found to be 871 tons/day.</description>

      <description>A couple of links:
 figshare is a site where scientists can share data sets/figures/code. One of the goals is to encourage researchers to share negative results as well. I think this is a great idea - I often find negative results and this could be a place to put them. It also uses a tagging system, like Flickr. I think this is a great idea for scientific research discovery. They give you unlimited public space and 1GB of private space.</description>

 If the bill passes, to read the results of federally funded research, most Americans would have to buy access to individual articles at a cost of $15 or $30 apiece. In other words, taxpayers who already paid for the research would have to pay again to read the results.</description>

We read newspapers, blogs, and the news sections of scientific journals to keep up with the coolest new research. But health science reporting, although exciting, can also be incredibly frustrating to read. Many articles have sensational titles, like &amp;#8220;How using Facebook could raise your risk of cancer&amp;#8221;. The articles go on to describe some research and interview a few scientists, then typically make fairly large claims about what the research means.</description>

      <description>Dick Berk is using his statistical superpowers to fight crime. Seriously. Here is my favorite paragraph.
 Drawing from criminal databases dating to the 1960s, Berk initially modeled the Philadelphia algorithm on more than 100,000 old cases, relying on three dozen predictors, including the perpetrator’s age, gender, neighborhood, and number of prior crimes. To develop an algorithm that forecasts a particular outcome—someone committing murder, for example—Berk applied a subset of the data to “train” the computer on which qualities are associated with that outcome.</description>

Back in the day when people like John von Neumann were busy inventing the computer to work out H-bomb calculations, there was more or less a renter model in place. Computers were obviously quite expensive and so not everyone could have one.</description>

      <title>Where do you get your data?</title>

      <guid>/2012/01/08/where-do-you-get-your-data/</guid>
      <description>Here&amp;#8217;s a question I get fairly frequently from various types of people: Where do you get your data? This is sometimes followed up quickly with &amp;#8220;Can we use some of your data?&amp;#8221;
My contention is that if someone asks you these questions, start looking for the exits.
There are of course legitimate reasons why someone might ask you this question. For example, they might be interested in the source of the data to verify its quality.</description>

      <description>This post written by Jeff Leek and Rafa Irizarry.
The p-value is the most widely-known statistic. P-values are reported in a large majority of scientific publications that measure and report data. R.A. Fisher is widely credited with inventing the p-value. If he was cited every time a p-value was reported his paper would have, at the very least, 3&amp;#160;million citations* - making it the most highly cited paper of all time.</description>

      <description>I started my professional Twitter account @leekgroup about a year and half ago at the suggestion of a colleague of mine, John Storey (@storeylab). I started using the account to post updates on papers/software my group was publishing. Basically, everything I used to report on my webpage as &amp;#8220;News&amp;#8221;. I started to give talks where the title slide included my Twitter name, rather than my webpage. It frequently drew the biggest laugh in the talk, and I would get comments like, &amp;#8220;Do you really think people care what you are thinking every moment of every day?</description>

      <description>Jeff recently posted links to data from cities and states. He and I wrote R code that plots gun offender locations for Baltimore. Specifically we plot the locations that appear on this table. I added locations of the Baltimore neighborhoods where most of our Hopkins colleagues live as well as the location of the medical institutions where we work. Note the corridor with no points between the West side (Barksdale territory) and East side (Prop Joe territory).</description>

      <description>It&amp;#8217;s the beginning of 2012 and statistics/data science has never been hotter. Some of the most important data is data collected about civic organizations. If you haven&amp;#8217;t seen Bill Gate&amp;#8217;s TED Talk about the importance of state budgets, you should watch it now. A major key to solving a lot of our economic problems lies in understanding and using data collected about cites and states. U.S. cities and states are jumping on this idea and our own Baltimore was one of the earliest adopters.</description>

      <title>Grad students in (bio)statistics - do a postdoc!</title>

      <description>Up until about 20 years ago, postdocs were scarce in Statistics. In contrast, during the same time period, it was rare for a Biology PhD to go straight into a tenure track position.
Driven mostly by the availability of research funding for those working in applied areas, postdocs are becoming much more common in our field and I think this is great. It is great for PhD students to expand their horizons during two years in which they don&amp;#8217;t have to worry about teaching, committee meetings, or grant writing.</description>

      <description>I wrote a little function to make a personalized map of who follows you or who you follow on Twitter. The idea for this function was inspired by some plots I discussed in a previous post. I also found a lot of really useful code over at flowing data here. The function uses the packages twitteR, maps, geosphere, and RColorBrewer. If you don&amp;#8217;t have the packages installed, when you source the twitterMap code, it will try to install them for you.</description>

      <description>As the academic job hunting season goes into effect many will be applying to a variety of different types of departments. In statistics, there is a pretty big separation between statistics departments, which tend to be in arts &amp;amp; sciences colleges, and biostatistics departments, which tend to be in medical or public health institutions. A key difference between these two types of departments is the funding model.
Statistics department faculty tend to be on 9- or 10-month salaries with funding primarily coming from teaching classes (research funding can be obtained for the summer months).</description>

      <description>In a recent post I described the importance of government statisticians. Well, apparently in Greece it is a dangerous job, as Andreas Georgiou, the person in charge of the Greek statistics office, found out.
 So far, though, his efforts have been met with resistance, strikes and a criminal investigation that could lead to life in prison for Georgiou.
 What are his efforts&amp;#160;?
 His first priority after he was appointed was to figure out how big Greece&amp;#8217;s deficit really was back in 2009, when the crisis began.</description>

      <description>The review times for most journals in our field are ridiculous. Check out Figure 1&amp;#160;here. A careful review takes time, but not six months. Let&amp;#8217;s be honest, those papers are sitting on desks for the great majority of those six months. But here is what really kills me: waiting six months for a review basically saying the paper is not of sufficient interest to the readership of the journal. That decision you can come to in half a day.</description>

      <description>Over the last week or so I&amp;#8217;ve been posting about the air pollution levels in Beijing, China. The twitter feed from the US Embassy there makes it easy to track the hourly levels of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and you can use this R code to make a graph of the data.
One problem with talking about particulate matter levels is that the units are a bit abstract. We usually talk in terms of micrograms per cubic meter (mcg/m^3), which is a certain mass of particles per volume of air.</description>

The Supreme Court heard oral arguments last week in the case Mayo Collaborative Services vs. Prometheus Laboratories (No 10-1150). At issue is a patent Prometheus Laboratories holds for making decisions about the treatment of disease on the basis of a measurement of a specific, naturally occurring molecule and a corresponding calculation. The specific language at issue is a little technical, but the key claim from the patent under dispute is:</description>

      <title>Interview w/ Mario Marazzi, Puerto Rico Institute of Statistics Director, on the importance of Government Statisticians</title>

      <description>[Desplace hacia abajo para traducción al español] In my opinion, the importance of government statisticians is underappreciated. In the US, agencies such as the CDC, the Census Bureau, and the Bureau of Labor Statistics employ statisticians to help collect and analyze data that contribute to important policy decisions. How many students will enroll in public schools this year? Is there a type II diabetes epidemic? Is unemployment rising? How many homeless people are in Los Angeles?</description>

The script defaults to the past 24 hours but you can modify that by simply changing the value for the variable &amp;#8216;n&amp;#8217;. You can just grab the code from this R script. Note that you need to use the latest version of the &amp;#8216;twitteR&amp;#8217; package because the data structure has changed from previous versions.</description>

Andrews on comparing particulate matter (PM) air pollution in China versus Europe and the US. China does not officially release fine PM measurements (PM2.5) and furthermore does not have an official standard for that metric. In the US, PM standards are generally focused on PM2.</description>

      <description>Checklist mania has hit clinical medicine thanks to people like Peter Pronovost and many others. The basic idea is that simple and short checklists along with changes to clinical culture can prevent major errors from occurring in medical practice. One particular success story is Pronovost&amp;#8217;s central line checklist which dramatically reduced bloodstream infections in hospital intensive care units. There are three important points about the checklist. First, it neatly summarizes information, bringing the latest evidence directly to clinical practice.</description>

      <description>I would like to define a new term: reverse scooping is when someone publishes your idea after you, and doesn&amp;#8217;t cite you. It has happened to me a few times. What does one do? I usually send a polite message to the authors with a link to my related paper(s). These emails are usually ignored, but not always. Most times I don&amp;#8217;t think it is malicious though. In fact, I almost reverse scooped a colleague recently.</description>

      <description>First of all, thanks to Rafa for scooping me with my own article. Not sure if that&amp;#8217;s reverse scooping or recursive scooping or&amp;#8230;.
The latest issue of _Science_ has a special section on Data Replication and Reproducibility. As part of the section I wrote a brief commentary on the need for reproducible research in computational science. _Science_ has a pretty tight word limit for it&amp;#8217;s commentaries and so it was unfortunately necessary to omit a number of relevant topics.</description>

      <description>If you&amp;#8217;re interested in know what the air quality looks like in Beijing China, the US Embassy there has a particulate matter monitor on its roof that tweets the level of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) every hour (see @BeijingAir). In case you&amp;#8217;re not used to staring at PM2.5 values all the time, let me provide some context.
The US National Ambient Air Quality Standard for the 24-hour average PM2.5 level is 35 mcg/m^3.</description>

      <description>A few weeks ago we learned that Warren Buffett is a big IBM fan (a $10 billion fan, that is). Having heard that I went over to the IBM web site to see what they&amp;#8217;re doing these days. For starters, they&amp;#8217;re not selling computers anymore! At least not the kind that I would use. One of the big things they do now is &amp;#8220;Business Analytics and Optimization&amp;#8221; (i.e. statistics), which is one of the reasons they bought SPSS and then later Algorithmics.</description>

      <description>Over the Thanksgiving recent break I naturally started thinking about reproducible research in between salting the turkey and making the turkey stock. Clearly, these things are all related. I sometimes get the sense that many people see reproducibility as essentially binary. A published paper is either reproducible, as in you can compute every single last numerical result to within epsilon precision, or it&amp;#8217;s not. My feeling is that there is a spectrum of reproducibility when it comes to published scientific findings.</description>

      <description>So along with a few folks here around Hopkins we have been kicking around the idea of developing an app for the iPhone/Android. I&amp;#8217;ll leave the details out for now (other than to say stay tuned!).
But to start developing an app for the iPhone, you need a version of Xcode, Apple&amp;#8217;s development environment. The latest version of Xcode is version 4, which can only be installed with the latest version of Mac OS X Lion (10.</description>

      <description>Google scholar has now made Google Scholar Citations profiles available to anyone. You can read about these profiles and set one up for yourself here.
I asked John Muschelli and Andrew Jaffeto write me a function that would download my Google Scholar Citations data so I could play with it. Then they got all crazy on it and wrote a couple of really neat functions. All cool/interesting components of these functions are their ideas and any bugs were introduced by me when I was trying to fiddle with the code at the end.</description>

      <description>There&amp;#8217;s in interesting discussion over at reddit on the difference between a data scientist and a statistician. My crude summary of the discussion seems to be that by and large they are the same but the phrase &amp;#8220;data scientist&amp;#8221; is just the hip new name for statistician that will probably sound stupid 5 years from now.
My question is why isn&amp;#8217;t &amp;#8220;statistician&amp;#8221; hip? The comments don&amp;#8217;t seem to address that much (although a few go in that direction).</description>

      <description>A recent article in the New York Times describes the backstory behind the decision to not revise the ozone national ambient air quality standard. This article highlights the reality of balancing the need to set air pollution regulation to protect public health and the desire to get re-elected. Not having ever served in politics (does being elected to the faculty senate count?) I can&amp;#8217;t comment on the political aspect. But I wanted to highlight some of the scientific evidence that goes into developing these standards.</description>

Now, they have compiled data from their personality survey and made it available online through Infochimps. We have talked about Infochimps before, it is basically a site for distributing/selling data.</description>

      <description>As a follow up to my previous post on expected salaries by majors I want to share the following graph:
So why is the cost of higher education going up at a faster rate than most everything else? Economists please correct me if I&amp;#8217;m wrong, but it must be that demand grew right? Universities are non-profits so they didn&amp;#8217;t necessarily have to respond by increasing offers. But apparently they did. So if the proportion of the population going to college grew, why is there a shortage of STEM majors?</description>

      <description>Jeff Leek and colleagues just published an article in PLoS ONE on the differences between anonymous (closed) and non-anonymous (open) peer review of research articles. They developed a &amp;#8220;peer review game&amp;#8221; as a model system to track authors&amp;#8217; and reviewers&amp;#8217; behavior over time under open and closed systems.
Under the open system, it was possible for authors to see who was reviewing their work. They found that under the open system authors and reviewers tended to cooperate by reviewing each others&amp;#8217; work.</description>

      <description>In thisrecent editorialabout the Occupy Wall Street movement, Richard Kim profiles a protestor that despite having a master&amp;#8217;s degree can&amp;#8217;t find a job. This particular protestorquit his job as a school teacher three years ago and took out a $35K student loan to obtain a master&amp;#8217;s degree in puppetry from the University of Connecticut. I wonder if, before taking his money, UConn showed this person data on job prospects for their puppetry graduates.</description>

I couldn&amp;#8217;t figure out an easy way to find statisticians in one go (which could be because I don&amp;#8217;t have Twitter skills). So here is my very informal list of statisticians I found in a half hour of searching.

      <description>Howard Chang, a former PhD student of mine now at Emory, just published a paper on a measurement error model for estimating the health effects of coarse particulate matter (PM). This is a cool paper that deals with the problem that coarse PM tends to be very spatially heterogeneous. Coarse PM is a bit of a hot topic now because there is currently no national ambient air quality standard for coarse PM specifically.</description>

      <description>In this NY Times article, Christopher Drew points out that many students planning engineering and science majors end up switching to other subjects or fail to get any degree. He argues that this is partly due todo the difficulty of classes. In a previous post we lamented the anemic growth in math and statistics majors in comparison to other majors. I do not think we should make our classes easier just to keep these students.</description>

      <guid>/2011/11/06/reproducible-research-notes-from-the-field/</guid>
      <description>Over the past year, I&amp;#8217;ve been doing a lot of talking about reproducible research. Talking to people, talking on panel discussions, and talking about some of my own work. It seems to me that interest in the topic has exploded recently, in part due to some recent scandals, such as the Duke clinical trials fiasco.
If you are unfamiliar with the term &amp;#8220;reproducible research&amp;#8221;, the basic idea is that authors of published research should make available the necessary materials so that others may reproduce to a very high degree of similarity the published findings.</description>

      <description>I am a huge fan of open access journals. I think open access is good both for moral reasons (science should be freely available) and for more selfish ones (I want people to be able to read my work). If given the choice, I would publish all of my work in journals that distribute results freely.
But it turns out that for most open/free access systems, the publishing charges are paid by the scientists publishing in the journals.</description>

      <description>Note: _This is a guest post by our colleagues Brian Caffo, Ani Eloyan, Fang Han, Han Liu,John Muschelli, Mary Beth Nebel, Tuo Zhao and Ciprian Crainiceanu. They won the ADHD 200 imaging data analysis competition. There has been some controversy around the results because one team obtained a higher score without using any of the imaging data. Our colleagues have put together a very clear discussion of the issues raised by the competition so we are publishing it here to contribute to the discussion.</description>

      <description>In this post Alex Tabarrok argues that not enough people are obtaining &amp;#8220;degrees that pay&amp;#8221; and that college has been oversold. It struck me that the number of students studying Visual and Performing Arts has more than doubled since 1985. Yet for Math and Statistics there has been no increase at all! We need to do a better job at marketing. The great majority (if not all) of the people I know with Statistics degrees have found a job related to Statistics.</description>

      <description>My article on computing on the language was unexpectedly popular and so I wanted to quickly follow up on my own solution. Many of you got the answer, and in fact many got solutions that were quite a bit shorter than mine. Here&amp;#8217;s how I did it:
makeList &amp;lt;- function(...) { args &amp;lt;- substitute(list(...)) nms &amp;lt;- sapply(args[-1], deparse) vals &amp;lt;- list(...) names(vals) &amp;lt;- nms vals }  Baptiste pointed out that Frank Harrell has already implemented this function in his Hmisc package as the &amp;#8216;llist&amp;#8217; function (thanks for the pointer!</description>

      <description>This fall I have been asked to write seven promotion letters. Writing these takes me at least 2 hours. If it&amp;#8217;s someone I don&amp;#8217;t know it takes me longer because I have to read some of their papers. Earlier this year, I wrote one for a Biology department that took me at least 6 hours. So how many are too many? Should I set a limit? Advice and opinions in the comments would be greatly appreciated.</description>

      <description>It seems like everywhere we look, data is being generated - from politics, to biology, to publishing, to social networks. There are also diverse new computational tools, like GPGPU and cloud computing, that expand the statistical toolbox. Statistical theory is more advanced than its ever been, with exciting work in a range of areas. With all the excitement going on around statistics, there is also increasing diversity. It is increasingly hard to define &amp;#8220;statistician&amp;#8221; since the definition ranges from very mathematical to very applied.</description>

      <description>And now for something a bit more esoteric&amp;#8230;.
I recently wrote a function to deal with a strange problem. Writing the function ended up being a fun challenge related to computing on the R language itself.
Here&amp;#8217;s the problem: Write a function that takes any number of R objects as arguments and returns a list whose names are derived from the names of the R objects.
Perhaps an example provides a better description.</description>

      <description>The internet is the greatest source of publicly available data. One of the key skills to being able to obtain data from the web is &amp;#8220;web-scraping&amp;#8221;, where you use a piece of software to run through a website and collect information. This technique can be used for collecting data from databases or to collect data that is scattered across a website. Here is a very cool little exercise in web-scraping that can be used as an example of the things that are possible.</description>

      <description>Here is a cool paper on the ArXiv about archetypal athletes. The basic idea is to look at a large number of variables for each player and identify multivariate outliers or extremes. These outliers are the archetypes talked about in the title. According to his analysis the author claims the best players (for different reasons, i.e. different archetypes) in the NBA in 2009&amp;frasl;2010 were: Taj Gibson, Anthony Morrow, and Kevin Durant.</description>

      <description>I love watching TED talks. One of my absolute favorites is the talk by Dan Meyer on how math class needs a makeover. Dan also has one of the more fascinating blogs I have read. He talks about math education, primarily K-12 education. His posts on curriculum design, assessment , work ethic, and homework are really, really good. In fact, just go read all his author choices. You won&amp;#8217;t regret it.</description>

      <description>Several months ago I was sitting next to my colleague Ben Langmead at the Genome Informatics meeting. Various talks were presented on short read alignments and every single performance table showed the speaker&amp;#8217;s method as #1 and Ben&amp;#8217;s Bowtie as #2 among a crowded field of lesser methods. It was fun to make fun of Ben for getting beat every time, but the reality was that all I could conclude was that Bowtie was best and speakers were falling into the the self-assessment trap: each speaker had tweaked the assessment to make their method look best.</description>

      <description>From the BBC a pretty fascinating radio piece.
 &amp;#8230;in the same way that a telescope enables you to see things that are too far away to see with the naked eye, a microscope enables you to see things that are too small to see with the naked eye, statistics enables you to see things in masses of data which are too complex for you to see with the naked eye.</description>

      <guid>/2011/10/20/finding-good-collaborators/</guid>
      <description>The job of the statistician is almost entirely about collaboration. Sure, there&amp;#8217;s theoretical work that we can do by ourselves, but most of the impact that we have on science comes from our work with scientists in other fields. Collaboration is also what makes the field of statistics so much fun.
So one question I get a lot from people is &amp;#8220;how do you find good collaborations&amp;#8221;? Or, put another way, how do you find good collaborators?</description>

      <description>Brian Caffo from the comments:
 Personal theorem: the application of statistics in any new field will be labeled &amp;#8220;Technical sounding word&amp;#8221; + ics. Examples: Sabermetrics, analytics, econometrics, neuroinformatics, bioinformatics, informatics, chemeometrics.
It&amp;#8217;s like how adding mayonnaise to anything turns it in to salad (eg: egg salad, tuna salad, ham salad, pasta salad, &amp;#8230;)
I&amp;#8217;d like to be the first to propose the statistical study of turning things in salad. So called mayonaisics.</description>

      <guid>/2011/10/19/do-we-really-need-applied-statistics-journals/</guid>
      <description>All statisticians in academia are constantly confronted with the question of where to publish their papers. Sometimes it&amp;#8217;s obvious: A theoretical paper might go to the Annals of Statistics orJASA Theory &amp;amp; Methods or Biometrika. A more &amp;#8220;methods-y&amp;#8221; paper might go to JASA or JRSS-B orBiometrics or maybe even Biostatistics (where all three of us are or have been associate editors).
But where should the applied papers go? I think this is an increasingly large category of papers being produced by statisticians.</description>

      <description>When doing data analysis, I often create a set of plots quickly just to explore the data and see what the general trends are. Later I go back and fiddle with the plots to make them look pretty for publication. But some people have taken this to the next level. Here are two plots made entirely in R:
The descriptions of how they were created are here and here.

      <description>Our colleague Brian Caffo and his team of statistics ninjas won the &amp;#8220;Imaging-Based Diagnostic Classification Contest&amp;#8221; as part of the ADHD 200 Global Competition. From the prize citation:
 The method developed by the team from Johns Hopkins University excelled in its specificity, or its ability to identify typically developing children (TDC) without falsely classifying them as ADHD-positive. They correctly classified 94% of TDC, showing that a diagnostic imaging methodology can be developed with a very low risk of false positives, a fantastic result.</description>

      <description>One of my favorite R packages that I use all the time is the RColorBrewer package. The package has been around for a while now and is written/maintained by Erich Neuwirth. The guts of the package are based on Cynthia Brewer&amp;#8217;s very cool work on the use of color in cartography (check out the colorbrewer web site).
As a side note, I think the ability to manipulate colors in plots/graphs/maps is one of R&amp;#8217;s many great strengths.</description>

It just blows my mind how influential his work was — developing the C language, Unix — and how so many pieces of technology bear his fingerprints. My first encounter with K&amp;amp;R was in college when I learned C programming in the “Data Structures and Programming Techniques” class at Yale (taught by Stan &amp;#8220;the man&amp;#8221; Eisenstadt).</description>

      <description>A way that universities grow in research fields for which they have no department is by creating institutes. Millions of dollars are invested to promote collaboration between existing faculty interested in the new field. But do they work? Does the university get their investment back? Through the years I have noticed that many institutes are nothing more than a webpage and others are so successful they practically become self-sustained entities. This paper (published in STM) led by John Hogenesch, uses data from papers and grants to evaluate an institute at Penn.</description>

      <description>The main role of academics is the creation of knowledge. In science, publications are the main venue by which we share our accomplishments, our ideas. Not surprisingly, publications are heavily weighted in hires and promotions. But with multiple author papers how do we know how much each author contributed? Here are some related links from Science and Nature and below I share some thoughts specific to Applied Statistics.
It is common for theoretical statisticians to publish solo papers.</description>

David Champagne, over at Revolution Analytics, described the skills for being a data scientist with a Venn Diagram. Just for fun, I wrote a little R function for determining where you land on the data science Venn Diagram. Here is an example of a plot the function makes using the Simply Statistics bloggers as examples.</description>

One of the main uses of these APIs is to allow software engineers to build apps on top of Facebook/Twitter/etc. Many APIs are really helpful for statisticians/data scientists as well. Using APIs, it is generally very easy to collect large amounts of interesting data. Here are some examples of APIs (you may need to sign up for accounts to get access to some of these).</description>

      <description>Here&amp;#8217;s a claim for which I have absolutely no data: I believe I am more productive with a smaller screen/monitor. I have a 13&amp;#8221; MacBook Air that I occasionally hook up to a 21-inch external monitor. Sometimes, when I want to read a document I&amp;#8217;ll hook up the external monitor so that I can see a whole page at a time. Other times, when I&amp;#8217;m using R, I&amp;#8217;ll have the graphics window on the external and then the R console and Emacs on the main screen.</description>

      <description>One question I get a lot about how to read large data frames into R. There are some useful tricks that can save you both time and memory when reading large data frames but I find that many people are not aware of them. Of course, your ability to read data is limited by your available memory. I usually do a rough calculation along the lines of
# rows * # columns * 8 bytes / 2^20</description>

      <title>A Really Cool Paper on the &#34;Hot Hand&#34; in Sports</title>

      <description>I just found this really cool paper on the phenomenon of the &amp;#8220;hot hand&amp;#8221; in sports. The idea behind the &amp;#8220;hot hand&amp;#8221; (also called the &amp;#8220;clustering illusion&amp;#8221;) is that success breeds success. In other words, when you are successful (you win games, you make free throws, you get hits) you will continue to be successful. In sports, it has frequently been observed that events are close to independent, meaning that the &amp;#8220;hot hand&amp;#8221; is just an illusion.</description>

      <description>Andrew Jaffe pointed me to prezi.com. It looks like a new way of making presentations. Andrew made an example here in just a couple of minutes. Here is one about Coca-Cola.
Things I like:  I go to a lot of Beamer/Powerpoint talks, these presentations at least look different and could be interesting.  It is cool how it is easy to arrange slides in a non-linear order and potentially avoid clicking forward a few slides then back a few slides I also like how the &amp;#8220;global picture&amp;#8221; of the talk can be shown in a display.</description>

      <description>As an academic who does a lot of research for a living, I spend a lot of my time writing and submitting papers. Before my time, this process involved sending multiple physical copies of a paper by snail mail to the editorial office. New technology has changed this process. Now to submit a paper you generally have to: (1) find a Microsoft Word or Latex template for the journal and use it for your paper and (2) upload the manuscript and figures (usually separately).</description>

      <description>Here is a paper where they scraped Twitter data over a year and showed how the the tweets corresponded with sleep patterns and diurnal rhythms. The coolest part of this paper is that these two guys just went out and collected the data for free. I wish they had focused on more interesting questions though, it seems like you could do a lot with data like this.  Since flu season is upon us, here is an interesting paper where the authors used data on friendship networks and class structure in a high school to study flu transmission.</description>

      <description>Rebranding of statistics as a field seems to be a popular topic these days and &amp;#8220;data science&amp;#8221; is one of the potential rebranding options. This article over at Revolutions is a nice summary of where the term comes from and what it means. This quote seems pretty accurate:
 My own take is that Data Science is a valuable rebranding of computer science and applied statistics skills.

      <description>I posted a while ago on how overconfidence may be a good thing. I just read this fascinating article by Neal Stephenson (via aldaily.com) about innovation starvation. The article focuses a lot on how science fiction inspires people to work on big/hard/impossible problems in science. Its a great read for the nerds in the audience. But one quote stuck out for me:
 Most people who work in corporations or academia have witnessed something like the following: A number of engineers are sitting together in a room, bouncing ideas off each other.</description>

      <description>Larry Ellison, the CEO of Oracle, like most technology CEOs, has a tendency for the over-the-top sales pitch. But it&amp;#8217;s fun to keep track of what these companies are up to just to see what they think the trends are. It seems clear that companies like IBM, Oracle, and HP, which focus substantially on the enterprise (or try to), think the future is data data data. One piece of evidence is the list of companies that they&amp;#8217;ve acquired recently.</description>

      <description>This article following up on the Moneyball PR demonstrates one of the reasons why statistics might be doomed:
 Julia Rozovsky is a Yale M.B.A. student who studied economics and math as an undergraduate, a background that prepared her for a traditional — and lucrative — consulting career. Instead, partly as a result of reading “Moneyball” and finding like-minded people, she pointed herself toward work in analytics.
 Why can&amp;#8217;t they call it statistics?</description>

      <description>Here is a pretty awesome TED talk by epidemiologist Ben Goldacre where he highlights how science can be used to deceive/mislead. It&amp;#8217;s sort of like epidemiology 101 in 15 minutes. This seems like a highly topical talk. Over on his blog, Steven Salzberg has pointed out that Dr. Oz has recently been engaging in some of these shady practices on his show. Too bad he didn&amp;#8217;t check out the video first.</description>

      <description>Amazon released it&amp;#8217;s new iPad competitor, the Kindle Fire, today. A quick read through the description shows it has some interesting features, including a custom-built web browser called Silk. One innovation that they claim is that the browser works in conjunction with Amazon&amp;#8217;s EC2 cloud computing platform to speed up the web-surfing experience by doing some computing on your end and some on their end. Seems cool, if it really does make things faster.</description>

      <description>Baseball Prospectus uses Monte Carlo simulation to predict which teams will make the postseason. According to this page, on Sept 1st, the probability of the Red Sox making the playoffs was 99.5%. They were ahead of the Tampa Bay Rays by 9 games. Before last night&amp;#8217;s game, in September, the Red Sox had lost 19 of 26 games and were tied with the Rays for the wild card (the last spot for the playoffs).</description>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;m not sure which of the categories this infographic on open data falls into, but I find it pretty exciting anyway. It shows the rise of APIs and how data are increasingly open. It seems like APIs are all over the place in the web development community, but less so in health statistics.

      <description>Stanford is offering a free online course and more than 100,000 students have registered. This got the blogosphere talking about the future of universities. Matt Yglesias thinks that &amp;#8220;colleges are the next newspaper and are destined for some very uncomfortable adjustments&amp;#8221;. Tyler Cowen reminded us that since 2003 he has been saying that professors are becoming obsolete. His main point is that thanks to the internet, the need for lecturers will greatly diminish.</description>

Think of all the great things we could do with this. We could, for example, plot p-value histograms for different disciplines. I bet most would have a flat distribution. We could also do it by specific association. A paper comes out saying chocolate is linked to weaker bones?</description>

      <description>A cool article on the regulator&amp;#8217;s dilemma. It turns out what is the best risk profile to prevent one bank from failing is not the best risk profile to prevent all banks from failing.  Persistence of web resources for computational biology. I think this one is particularly relevant for academic statisticians since a lot of academic software/packages are developed by graduate students. Once they move on, a large chunk of &amp;#8220;institutional knowledge&amp;#8221; is lost.</description>

      <description>Most Statistics and Biostatistics departments have weekly seminars. We usually invite outside speakers to share their knowledge via a 50 minute powerpoint (or beamer) presentation. This gives us the opportunity to meet colleagues from other Universities and pick their brains in small group meetings. This is all great. But, giving a good one hour seminar is hard. Really hard. Few people can pull it off. I propose to the statistical community that we cut the seminars to 25 minutes with 35 minutes for questions and further discussion.</description>

Our lab meetings and classes were constantly delayed due to missing dongles. Communism solved this problem. We bought 10 dongles, sprinkled them around the department, and declared all dongles public property. All dongles, not just the 10. No longer do we have to ask to borrow dongles because they have no owner.</description>

      <description>A little while ago, over at Genomes Unzipped, Joe Pickrell asked, &amp;#8220;Why publish science in peer reviewed journals?&amp;#8221; He points out the flaws with the current peer review system and suggests how we can do better. What he suggests is missing is the killer app for peer review. Well, PLoS has now developed an API, where you can easily access tons of data on the papers published in those journals including downloads, citations, number of social bookmarks, and mentions in major science blogs.</description>

      <description>Bill James pointed this out a long time ago. If you don&amp;#8217;t know Bill James, you should look him up. I consider him to be one of the most influential statisticians of all times. This post relates to one of his first conjectures: sacrificing outs for runs, referred to as small ball, is a bad strategy. ESPN&amp;#8217;s Gamecast, a webtool that gives you pitch-by-pitch updates of baseball games, also gives you a pitch-by-pitch &amp;#8220;probability&amp;#8221; of wining.</description>

      <description>The new MacArthur Fellows list is out and, as usual, they are an interesting bunch. One person that I thought was worth pointing out is Shwetak Patel. I had the privilege of meeting Shwetak at a National Research Council meeting on sustainability and computer science. Basically, he&amp;#8217;s working on devices that you can install in your home to monitor your resource usage. He&amp;#8217;s already spun-off a startup company to make/sell some of these devices.</description>

      <title>Private health insurers to release data</title>

      <guid>/2011/09/20/private-health-insurers-to-release-data/</guid>
      <description>It looks like four major private health insurance companies will be releasing data for use by academic researchers. They will create a non-profit institute called the Health Care Cost Institute and deposit the data there. Researchers can request the data from the institute by (I&amp;#8217;m guessing) writing a short proposal.
Health insurance billing claims data might not sound all that exciting, but they are a gold mine of very interesting information about population health.</description>

      <description>Roger pointed us to this Amstat news profile of statisticians including one on Francesca Dominici. Francesca has used her statistics skills to become a top environmental scientist. She had this advice for young [academic] statisticians:
 First, I would say find a good mentor in or outside the department. Prioritize, manage your time, and identify the projects you would like to lead. Focus the most productive time of day on those projects.</description>

      <description>Just in case you forgot to renew your subscription to Amstat News, there&amp;#8217;s a nice little profile of statisticians (including my good colleague Francesca Dominici) in the latest issue explaining how they ended up where they are.
I remember a few years ago I was at a dinner for our MPH program and the director at the time, Ron Brookmeyer, told all the students to ask the faculty how they ended up in public health.</description>

      <description>In this TED talk Jason Fried explains why work doesn&amp;#8217;t happen at work. He describes the evils of meetings. Meetings are particularly disruptive for applied statisticians, especially for those of us that hack data files, explore data for systematic errors, get inspiration from visual inspection, and thoroughly test our code. Why? Before I become productive I go through a ramp-up/boot-up stage. Scripts need to be found, data loaded into memory, and most importantly, my brains needs to re-familiarize itself with the data and the essence of the problem at hand.</description>

      <description>Thanks to Hilary Parker for pointing out Google Fusion Tables. The coolest thing here, from my self-centered spatial statistics point of view, is that it automatically geocodes locations for you. So you can upload a spreadsheet of addresses and it will map them for you on Google Maps.
Unfortunately, there doesn&amp;#8217;t seem to be an easy way to extract the latitude/longitude values, but I&amp;#8217;m hoping that&amp;#8217;s just a quick hack away&amp;#8230;.</description>

      <description>From a cool review about communicating risk to people without statistical/probabilistic training.
 Despite the burgeoning interest in infographics, there is limited experimental evidence on how different types of visualizations are processed and understood, although the effectiveness of some graphics clearly depends on the relative numeracy of an audience.

      <description>Liberal arts colleges are option that falls close to the 75% hard/25% soft option described by Rafa in his advice for folks on the job market. At these schools the teaching load may be even a little heavier than schools like Berkeley/Duke; the students will usually be exclusively undergraduates. Examples of this kind of place are Pomona College, Carleton College, Grinnell College, etc. The teaching load is the focus at places like this, but research plays an increasingly major role for academic faculty.</description>

      <description>A paper came out in the latest issue of Nature called the &amp;#8220;Evolution of Confidence&amp;#8221;. The authors describe a simple model where two participants are competing for a resource. They can either both claim the resource, only one can claim the resource, or neither can. If the ratio of the value of the resource over the cost of competition is good enough, then it makes sense to be overconfident about your abilities to obtain it.</description>

      <description>Today the results of a study I&amp;#8217;ve been involved with for a long time (read: since my early graduate school days) came out in PLoS Medicine (also Princeton News coverage, Eurekalert press release).
We looked at gene expression profiles - how much each of your 20,000 genes is turned on or turned off - in patients who had experienced blunt force trauma. Using these profiles we were able to distinguish very early on which of the patients were going to have positive or negative health trajectories.</description>

Openings are already being posted here, here, and here. So you should have your CV, research statement, and web page ready. I highly recommend having a web page. It doesn&amp;#8217;t have to be fancy. Here, here, and here are some good ones ranging from simple to a bit over the top. Minimum requirements are a list of publications and a link to a CV. If you have written software, link to that as well.</description>

A paper by this pair describing the details was published in the Annals of Applied Statistics as most of the Biology journals refused to publish their letters to the editor.</description>

      <description>This Column was written by Terry Speed in 2006 and is reprinted with permission from the IMS Bulletin, http://bulletin.imstat.org
In the generation of my teachers, say from 1935 to 1960, relatively few statisticians were trained for the profession. The majority seemed to come from mathematics, without any specialized statistical training. There was also a sizeable minority coming from other areas, such as astronomy (I can think of one prominent example), chemistry or chemical engineering (three), economics (several), history (one), medicine (several), physics (two), and psychology (several).</description>

      <description>Mark Hansen is easily one of my favorite statisticians today. He is a Professor of Statistics at UCLA and his collaborations with artists have brought data visualization to a whole new place, one that is both informative and moving. Here is a video of his project with Ben Rubin called Listening Post. The installation grabs conversations from unrestricted chat rooms and processes them in real-time to create interesting &amp;#8220;themes&amp;#8221; or &amp;#8220;movements&amp;#8221;.</description>

      <description>Not only are data analytics companies getting scooped up left and right, &amp;#8220;data science&amp;#8221; is blowing up as a career. Data science is sort of an amorphous term, like any hot topic (e.g., cloud computing). Regardless, people who can crunch numbers and find patterns are in high-demand, and I&amp;#8217;m not the only one saying so.
Don&amp;#8217;t believe the hype? Search for &amp;#8220;data&amp;#8221; on the career site of Amazon, Google, Facebook, Groupon, Livingsocial, Square, &amp;#8230;.</description>

      <description>Okay, this is not really about pre-cog, but just a pointer to some data that might be of interest to people. A number of cities post their crime data online, ready for scraping and data analysis. For example, the Baltimore Sun has a Google map of homicides in the city of Baltimore. There&amp;#8217;s also some data for Oakland.
Looking at the map is fun, but not particularly useful from a data analysis standpoint.</description>

      <description>Many case studies I find interesting don&amp;#8217;t appear in JASA Applications and Case Studies or other applied statistics journals for that matter. Some because the technical skill needed to satisfy reviewers is not sufficiently impressive, others because they lack mathematical rigor. But perhaps the main reason for this disconnect is that many interesting case studies are developed by people outside our field or outside academia.
In this blog we will try to introduce readers to some of these case studies.</description>

We&amp;#8217;ll be posting ideas we find interesting, contributing to discussion of science/popular writing, and linking to articles that inspire us. Why &amp;#8220;Simply Statistics&amp;#8221;:
We needed a title. Plus, we like the idea of using simple statistics to solve real, important problems. We aren&amp;#8217;t fans of unnecessary complication - that just leads to lies, damn lies and something else.</description>
