Amanda Cox received her M.S. in statistics from the University of Washington in 2005. She then moved to the New York Times, where she is a graphics editor. She, and the graphics team at the New York Times, are responsible for many of the cool, informative, and interactive graphics produced by the Times.

A favorite quote of mine, &amp;#8220;But rather than bringing clarity, it just sort of looked chaotic, even to the seasoned chart freaks of 620 8th Avenue.&amp;#8221; One of the more interesting things about posts like this is you get to see how statistics versus a deadline works.</description>
