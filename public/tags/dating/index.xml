      <description>OK Cupid is an online dating site that has grown its visibility in part through a pretty awesome blog called OK Trends, where they have analyzed their online dating data to, for example, show you what kind of profile picture works best. Now, they have compiled data from their personality survey and made it available online through Infochimps. We have talked about Infochimps before, it is basically a site for distributing/selling data.</description>
