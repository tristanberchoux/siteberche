      <description>I&amp;#8217;m about to head out for JSM in a couple of weeks. The sheer magnitude of the conference means it is pretty hard to figure out what talks I should attend. One approach I&amp;#8217;ve used in the past is to identify people who I know give good talks and go to their talks. But that isn&amp;#8217;t a very good talk-discovery mechanism.

Here are a few of the things I think are key, I try to do them and have learned many of these things from other people who I&amp;#8217;ve seen speak.</description>
