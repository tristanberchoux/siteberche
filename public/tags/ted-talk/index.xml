      <description>Here is a pretty awesome TED talk by epidemiologist Ben Goldacre where he highlights how science can be used to deceive/mislead. It&amp;#8217;s sort of like epidemiology 101 in 15 minutes.Â This seems like a highly topical talk. Over on his blog, Steven Salzberg has pointed out that Dr. Oz has recently been engaging in some of these shady practices on his show. Too bad he didn&amp;#8217;t check out the video first.</description>
