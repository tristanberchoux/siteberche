      <description>There has been a lot of talk about the Michael Lewis (of Moneyball fame) profile of Obama in Vanity fair. One interesting quote I think deserves a lot more discussion is: &amp;#8220;On top of all of this, after you have made your decision, you need to feign total certainty about it. People being led do not want to think probabilistically.&amp;#8221; This is a key issue that is only going to get worse going forward.</description>

      <description>A really nice explanation of the elements of Obamacare. Rafa&amp;#8217;s post on the new inHealth initiative Scott is leading got a lot of comments on Reddit. Some of them are funny (Rafa&amp;#8217;s spelling got rocked) and if you get past the usual level of internet-commentary politeness, some of them seem to be really relevant - especially the comments about generalizability and the economics of health care.  From Andrew J.</description>

      <description>Amanda Cox on the process they went through to come up with this graphic about the Facebook IPO. So cool to see how R is used in the development process. A favorite quote of mine, &amp;#8220;But rather than bringing clarity, it just sort of looked chaotic, even to the seasoned chart freaks of 620 8th Avenue.&amp;#8221; One of the more interesting things about posts like this is you get to see how statistics versus a deadline works.</description>

      <title>Why does Obama need statisticians?</title>

      <description>It&amp;#8217;s worth following up a little on why the Obama campaign is recruiting statisticians (note to Karen: I am not looking for a new job!). Here&amp;#8217;s the blurb for the position of &amp;#8220;Statistical Modeling Analyst&amp;#8221;:
 The Obama for America Analytics Department analyzes the campaign&amp;#8217;s data to guide election strategy and develop quantitative, actionable insights that drive our decision-making. Our team&amp;#8217;s products help direct work on the ground, online and on the air.</description>
