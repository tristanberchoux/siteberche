  <strong><br /></strong><a href="http://had.co.nz/" target="_blank">Hadley Wickham </a>is the Dobelman Family Junior Chair of Statistics at Rice University. Prior to moving to Rice, he completed his Ph.D. in Statistics from Iowa State University. He is the developer of the wildly popular <a href="http://had.co.nz/ggplot2/" target="_blank">ggplot2</a> software for data visualization and a contributor to the <a href="http://www.ggobi.org/" target="_blank">Ggobi </a>project. He has developed a number of really useful R packages touching everything from data processing, to data modeling, to visualization.

<div class="im">
  <strong>Which term applies to you: data scientist, statistician, computer</strong><br /><strong>scientist, or something else?</strong></p>
</div>

<p><span>I&#8217;m an assistant professor of statistics, so I at least partly</span><br />
<span>associate with statistics :).  But the idea of data science really</span><br />
<span>resonates with me: I like the combination of tools from statistics and</span><br />
<span>computer science, data analysis and hacking, with the core goal of</span><br />
<span>developing a better understanding of data. Sometimes it seems like not</span><br />
<span>much statistics research is actually about gaining insight into data.</span></p>

<div class="im">
  <strong>You have created/maintain several widely used R packages. Can you</strong><br /><strong>describe the unique challenges to writing and maintaining packages</strong><br /><strong>above and beyond developing the methods themselves?</strong></p>
</div>

<p>I think there are two main challenges: turning ideas into code, and<br />
documentation and community building.</p>

<p>Compared to other languages, the software development infrastructure<br />
in R is weak, which sometimes makes it harder than necessary to turn<br />
my ideas into code. Additionally, I get less and less time to do<br />
software development, so I can&#8217;t afford to waste time recreating old<br />
bugs, or releasing packages that don&#8217;t work. Recently, I&#8217;ve been<br />
investing time in helping build better dev infrastructure; better<br />
tools for documentation <a href="http://github.com/klutometis/roxygen" target="_blank">[roxygen2]</a>, unit testing <a href="https://github.com/hadley/test_that" target="_blank">[testthat]</a>, package development <a href="https://github.com/hadley/devtools" target="_blank">[devtools]</a>, and creating package website <a href="https://github.com/hadley/staticdocs" target="_blank">[staticdocs]</a>. Generally, I&#8217;ve<br />
found unit tests to be a worthwhile investment: they ensure you never<br />
accidentally recreate an old bug, and give you more confidence when<br />
radically changing the implementation of a function.</p>

<p>Documenting code is hard work, and it&#8217;s certainly something I haven&#8217;t<br />
mastered. But documentation is absolutely crucial if you want people<br />
to use your work. I find the main challenge is putting yourself in the<br />
mind of the new user: what do they need to know to use the package<br />
effectively. This is really hard to do as a package author because<br />
you&#8217;ve internalised both the motivating problem and many of the common<br />
solutions.</p>

<p>Connected to documentation is building up a community around your<br />
work. This is important to get feedback on your package, and can be<br />
helpful for reducing the support burden. One of the things I&#8217;m most<br />
proud of about ggplot2 is something that I&#8217;m barely responsible for:<br />
the ggplot2 mailing list. There are now ggplot2 experts who answer far<br />
more questions on the list than I do. I&#8217;ve also found github to be<br />
great: there&#8217;s an increasing community of users proficient in both R<br />
and git who produce pull requests that fix bugs and add new features.</p>

<p>The flip side of building a community is that as your work becomes<br />
more popular you need to be more careful when releasing new versions.<br />
The last major release of ggplot2 (0.9.0) broke over 40 (!!) CRAN<br />
packages, and forced me to rethink my release process. Now I advertise<br />
releases a month in advance, and run `R CMD check` on all downstream<br />
dependencies (`devtools::revdep_check` in the development version), so<br />
I can pick up potential problems and give other maintainers time to<br />
fix any issues.</p>

<div class="im">
  <strong>Do you feel that the academic culture has caught up with and supports</strong><br /><strong>non-traditional academic contributions (e.g. R packages instead of</strong><br /><strong>papers)?</strong></p>
</div>

<p><span>It&#8217;s hard to tell. I think it&#8217;s getting better, but it&#8217;s still hard to</span><br />
<span>get recognition that software development is an intellectual activity</span><br />
<span>in the same way that developing a new mathematical theorem is. I try</span><br />
<span>to hedge my bets by publishing papers to accompany my major packages:</span><br />
<span>I&#8217;ve also found the peer-review process very useful for improving the</span><br />
<span>quality of my software. Reviewers from both the R journal and the</span><br />
<span>Journal of Statistical Software have provided excellent suggestions</span><br />
<span>for enhancements to my code.</span></p>

<div class="im">
  <strong>You have given presentations at several start-up and tech companies.</strong><br /><strong>Do the corporate users of your software have different interests than</strong><br /><strong>the academic users?</strong></p>
</div>

<p><span>By and large, no. Everyone, regardless of domain, is struggling to</span><br />
<span>understand ever larger datasets. Across both industry and academia,</span><br />
<span>practitioners are worried about reproducible research and thinking</span><br />
<span>about how to apply the principles of software engineering to data</span><br />
<span>analysis.</span></p>

<div class="im">
  <strong>You gave one of my favorite presentations called Tidy Data/Tidy Tools</strong><br /><strong>at the NYC Open Statistical Computing Meetup. What are the key</strong><br /><strong>elements of tidy data that all applied statisticians should know?</strong></p>
</div>

<p>Thanks! Basically, make sure you store your data in a consistent<br />
format, and pick (or develop) tools that work with that data format.<br />
The more time you spend munging data in the middle of an analysis, the<br />
less time you have to discover interesting things in your data. I&#8217;ve<br />
tried to develop a consistent philosophy of data that means when you<br />
use my packages (particularly <a href="http://plyr.had.co.nz/" target="_blank">plyr</a> and <a href="http://had.co.nz/ggplot2/" target="_blank">ggplot2</a>), you can focus on the<br />
data analysis, not on the details of the data format. The principles<br />
of tidy data that I adhere to are that every column should be a<br />
variable, every row an observation, and different types of data should<br />
live in different data frames. (If you&#8217;re familiar with database<br />
normalisation this should sound pretty familiar!). I expound these<br />
principles in depth in my in-progress <a href="http://vita.had.co.nz/papers/tidy-data.html" target="_blank">[paper on the<br />topic]</a>. </p>

<div class="im">
  <strong>How do you decide what project to work on next? Is your work inspired</strong><br /><strong>by a particular application or more general problems you are trying to</strong><br /><strong>tackle?</strong></p>
</div>

<p>Very broadly, I&#8217;m interested in the whole process of data analysis:<br />
the process that takes raw data and converts it into understanding,<br />
knowledge and insight. I&#8217;ve identified three families of tools<br />
(manipulation, modelling and visualisation) that are used in every<br />
data analysis, and I&#8217;m interested both in developing better individual<br />
tools, but also smoothing the transition between them. In every good<br />
data analysis, you must iterate multiple times between manipulation,<br />
modelling and visualisation, and anything you can do to make that<br />
iteration faster yields qualitative improvements to the final analysis<br />
(that was one of the driving reasons I&#8217;ve been working on tidy data).</p>

<p>Another factor that motivates a lot of my work is teaching. I hate<br />
having to teach a topic that&#8217;s just a collection of special cases,<br />
with no underlying theme or theory. That drive lead to <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/stringr/index.html" target="_blank">[stringr]</a> (for<br />
string manipulation) and <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/lubridate/index.html" target="_blank">[lubridate]</a> (with Garrett Grolemund for working<br />
with dates). I recently released the <a href="https://github.com/hadley/httr" target="_blank">[httr]</a> package which aims to do a similar thing for http requests - I think this is particularly important as more and more data starts living on the web and must be accessed through an API.</p>

<div class="im">
  <strong>What do you see as the biggest open challenges in data visualization</strong><br /><strong>right now? Do you see interactive graphics becoming more commonplace?</strong></p>
</div>

<p>I think one of the biggest challenges for data visualisation is just<br />
communicating what we know about good graphics. The first article<br />
decrying 3d bar charts was <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/2682265" target="_blank">published in 1951</a>! Many plots still use<br />
rainbow scales or red-green colour contrasts, even though we&#8217;ve known<br />
for decades that those are bad. How can we ensure that people<br />
producing graphics know enough to do a good job, without making them<br />
read hundreds of papers? It&#8217;s a really hard problem.</p>

<p>Another big challenge is balancing the tension between exploration and<br />
presentation. For explotary graphics, you want to spend five seconds<br />
(or less) to create a plot that helps you understand the data, while you might spend<br />
five hours on a plot that&#8217;s persuasive to an audience who<br />
isn&#8217;t as intimately familiar with the data as you. To date, we have<br />
great interactive graphics solutions at either end of the spectrum<br />
(e.g. ggobi/iplots/manet vs d3) but not much that transitions from one<br />
end of the spectrum to the other. This summer I&#8217;ll be spending some<br />
time thinking about what ggplot2 + <a href="http://d3js.org/" target="_blank">[d3]</a>, might<br />
equal, and how we can design something like an interactive grammar of<br />
graphics that lets you explore data in R, while making it easy to<br />
publish interaction presentation graphics on the web.</p>
