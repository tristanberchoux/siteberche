      <description>Our colleague Brian Caffo and his team of statistics ninjas won the &amp;#8220;Imaging-Based Diagnostic Classification Contest&amp;#8221; as part of the ADHD 200 Global Competition. From the prize citation:
 The method developed by the team from Johns Hopkins University excelled in itsÂ specificity, or its ability to identify typically developing children (TDC) without falsely classifying them as ADHD-positive. They correctly classified 94% of TDC, showing that a diagnostic imaging methodology can be developed with a very low risk of false positives, a fantastic result.</description>
