  <strong>Do you consider yourself a statistician, data scientist, computer scientist, or something else?</strong></p>
</div>

<p><span>Good question.  Short answer: apparently somewhere along the way I</span><br />
<span>became a biologist, but with a heavy dose of &#8220;computational scientist&#8221;</span><br />
<span>in there.</span></p>

<p><span>The longer answer?  Well, it&#8217;s a really long answer&#8230;</span></p>

<p><span>My first research was on Avida, a bottom-up model for evolution that</span><br />
<span>Chris Adami, Charles Ofria and I wrote together at Caltech in 1993:</span><br />
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avida" target="_blank"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avida" target="_blank"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avida">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avida</a></a></a><span>.  (Fun fact: Chris, Charles and I</span><br />
<span>are now all faculty at Michigan State!  Chris and I have offices one</span><br />
<span>door apart, and Charles has an office one floor down.)  Avida got me</span><br />
<span>very interested in biology, but not in the undergrad &#8220;memorize stuff&#8221;</span><br />
<span>biology &#8212; more in research.  This was computational science: using</span><br />
<span>simple models to study biological phenomena.</span></p>

<p><span>While continuing evolution research, I did my undergrad in pure math at Reed</span><br />
<span>College, which was pretty intense; I worked in the Software Development</span><br />
<span>lab there, which connected me to a bunch of reasonably well known hackers</span><br />
<span>including Keith Packard, Mark Galassi, and Nelson Minar.</span></p>

<p><span>I also took a year off and worked on Earthshine:</span></p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planetshine#Earthshine" target="_blank"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planetshine#Earthshine" target="_blank"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planetshine#Earthshine">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planetshine#Earthshine</a></a></a></p>

<p><span>and then rebooted the project as an RA in 1997, the summer after</span><br />
<span>graduation.  This was mostly data analysis, although it included a</span><br />
<span>fair amount of hanging off of telescopes adjusting things as the</span><br />
<span>freezing winter wind howled through the Big Bear Solar Observatory&#8217;s</span><br />
<span>observing room, aka &#8220;data acquisition&#8221;.</span></p>

<p><span>After Reed, I applied to a bunch of grad schools, including Princeton</span><br />
<span>and Caltech in bio, UW in Math, and UT Austin and Ohio State in</span><br />
<span>physics.  I ended up at Caltech, where I switched over to</span><br />
<span>developmental biology and (eventually) regulatory genomics and genome</span><br />
<span>biology in Eric Davidson&#8217;s lab.  My work there included quite a bit</span><br />
<span>of wet bench biology, which is not something many people associate with me,</span><br />
<span>but was nonetheless something I did!</span></p>

<p><span>Genomics was really starting to hit the fan in the early 2000s, and I</span><br />
<span>was appalled by how biologists were handling the data &#8212; as one</span><br />
<span>example, we had about $500k worth of sequences sitting on a shared</span><br />
<span>Windows server, with no metadata or anything &#8212; just the filenames.</span><br />
<span>As another example, I watched a postdoc manually BLAST a few thousand</span><br />
<span>ESTs against the NCBI nr database; he sat there and did them three by</span><br />
<span>three, having figured out that he could concatenate three sequences</span><br />
<span>together and then manually deconvolve the results.  As probably the</span><br />
<span>most computationally experienced person in the lab, I quickly got</span><br />
<span>involved in data analysis and Web site stuff, and ended up writing</span><br />
<span>some comparative sequence analysis software that was mildly popular</span><br />
<span>for a while.</span></p>

<p><span>As part of the sequence analysis Web site I wrote, I became aware that</span><br />
<span>maintaining software was a <em>really</em> hard problem.  So, towards the end</span><br />
<span>of my 9 year stint in grad school, I spent a few years getting into</span><br />
<span>testing, both Web testing and more generally automated software</span><br />
<span>testing.  This led to perhaps my most used piece of software, twill, a</span><br />
<span>scripting language for Web testing.  It also ended up being one of the</span><br />
<span>things that got me elected into the Python Software Foundation,</span><br />
<span>because I was doing everything in Python (which is a really great</span><br />
<span>language, incidentally).</span></p>

<p><span>I also did some microbial genome analysis (which led to my first</span><br />
<span>completely reproducible paper (</span><span class="il">Brown</span><span> and Callan, 2004;</span><br />
<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14983022" target="_blank"><a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14983022" target="_blank"><a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14983022">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14983022</a></a></a><span>) and collaborated with the</span><br />
<span>Orphan lab on some metagenomics:</span><br />
<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=18467493" target="_blank"><a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=18467493" target="_blank"><a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=18467493">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=18467493</a></a></a><span>.  This led to a</span><br />
<span>fascination with the biological &#8220;dark matter&#8221; in nature that is the</span><br />
<span>subject of some of my current work on metagenomics.</span></p>

<p><span>I landed my faculty position at MSU right out of grad school, because</span><br />
<span>bioinformatics is sexy and CS departments are OK with hiring grad</span><br />
<span>students as faculty.  However, I deferred for two years to do a</span><br />
<span>postdoc in Marianne Bronner-Fraser&#8217;s lab because I wanted to switch to</span><br />
<span>the chick as a model organism, and so I ended up arriving at MSU in</span><br />
<span>2009.  I had planned to focus a lot on development gene regulatory</span><br />
<span>networks, but 2009 was when Illumina sequencing hit, and as one of the</span><br />
<span>few people around who wasn&#8217;t visibly frightened by the term &#8220;gigabyte&#8221;</span><br />
<span>I got inextricably involved in a lot of different sequence analysis</span><br />
<span>projects.  These all converged on assembly, and, well, that seems to</span><br />
<span>be what I work on now :).</span></p>

<p><span>The two strongest threads that run through my research are these:</span></p>

<p><span>1. &#8220;better science through superior software&#8221; &#8212; so much of science</span><br />
<span>depends on computational inference these days, and so little of the</span><br />
<span>underlying software is &#8220;good&#8221;.  Scientists <em>really</em> suck at software</span><br />
<span>development (for both good and bad reasons) and I worry that a lot of</span><br />
<span>our current science is on a really shaky foundation.  This is one</span><br />
<span>reason I&#8217;m invested in Software Carpentry</span><br />
<span>(</span><a href="http://software-carpentry.org/" target="_blank"><a href="http://software-carpentry.org" target="_blank"><a href="http://software-carpentry.org">http://software-carpentry.org</a></a></a><span>), a training program that Greg Wilson</span><br />
<span>has been developing &#8212; he and I agree that science is our best hope</span><br />
<span>for a positive future, and good software skills are going to be</span><br />
<span>essential for a lot of that science.  More generally I hope to turn</span><br />
<span>good software development into a competitive advantage for my lab</span><br />
<span>and my students.</span></p>

<p><span>2. &#8220;better hypothesis generation is needed&#8221; &#8212; biologists, in</span><br />
<span>particular, tend to leap towards the first testable hypothesis they</span><br />
<span>find.  This is a cultural thing stemming (I think) from a lot of</span><br />
<span>really bad interactions with theory: the way physicists and</span><br />
<span>mathematicians think about the world simply doesn&#8217;t fit with the Rube</span><br />
<span>Goldberg-esque features of biology (see</span><br />
<a href="http://ivory.idyll.org/blog/is-discovery-science-really-bogus.html" target="_blank"><a href="http://ivory.idyll.org/blog/is-discovery-science-really-bogus.html" target="_blank"><a href="http://ivory.idyll.org/blog/is-discovery-science-really-bogus.html">http://ivory.idyll.org/blog/is-discovery-science-really-bogus.html</a></a></a><span>).</span></p>

<p><span>So getting back to the question, uh, yeah, I think I&#8217;m a computational</span><br />
<span>scientist who is working on biology?  And if I need to write a little</span><br />
<span>(or a lot) of software to solve my problems, I&#8217;ll do that, and I&#8217;ll</span><br />
<span>try to do it with some attention to good software development</span><br />
<span>practice &#8212; not just out of ethical concern for correctness, but</span><br />
<span>because it makes our research move faster.</span></p>

<p><span>One thing I&#8217;m definitely <em>not</em> is a statistician.  I have friends who</span><br />
<span>are statisticians, though, and they seem like perfectly nice people.</span></p>

<div class="im">
  <strong>You have a pretty radical approach to open access, can you tell us a little bit about that?</strong></p>
</div>

<p><span>Ever since Mark Galassi introduced me to open source, I thought it</span><br />
<span>made sense.  So I&#8217;ve been an open source-nik since &#8230; 1988?</span></p>

<p><span>From there it&#8217;s just a short step to thinking that open science makes</span><br />
<span>a lot of sense, too.  When you&#8217;re a grad student or a postdoc, you</span><br />
<span>don&#8217;t get to make those decisions, though; it took until I was a PI</span><br />
<span>for me to start thinking about how to do it.  I&#8217;m still conflicted</span><br />
<span>about <em>how</em> open to be, but I&#8217;ve come to the conclusion that posting</span><br />
<span>preprints is obvious</span><br />
<span>(</span><a href="http://ivory.idyll.org/blog/blog-practicing-open-science.html" target="_blank"><a href="http://ivory.idyll.org/blog/blog-practicing-open-science.html" target="_blank"><a href="http://ivory.idyll.org/blog/blog-practicing-open-science.html">http://ivory.idyll.org/blog/blog-practicing-open-science.html</a></a></a><span>).</span></p>

<p><span>The &#8220;radical&#8221; aspect that you&#8217;re referring to is probably my posting</span><br />
<span>of grants (</span><a href="http://ivory.idyll.org/blog/grants-posted.html" target="_blank"><a href="http://ivory.idyll.org/blog/grants-posted.html" target="_blank"><a href="http://ivory.idyll.org/blog/grants-posted.html">http://ivory.idyll.org/blog/grants-posted.html</a></a></a><span>).  There are</span><br />
<span>two reasons I ended up posting all of my single-PI grants.  Both have</span><br />
<span>their genesis in this past summer, when I spent about 5 months writing</span><br />
<span>6 different grants &#8212; 4 of which were written entirely by me.  Ugh.</span></p>

<p><span>First, I was really miserable one day and joked on Twitter that &#8220;all</span><br />
<span>this grant writing is really cutting into my blogging&#8221; &#8212; a mocking</span><br />
<span>reference to the fact that grant writing (to get $$) is considered</span><br />
<span>academically worthwhile, while blogging (which communicates with the</span><br />
<span>public and is objectively quite valuable) counts for naught with my</span><br />
<span>employer.  Jonathan Eisen responded by suggesting that I post all of</span><br />
<span>the grants and I thought, what a great idea!</span></p>

<p><span>Second, I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;s escaped most people (hah!), but grant funding</span><br />
<span>rates are in the toilet &#8212; I spent all summer writing grants while</span><br />
<span>expecting most of them to be rejected.  That&#8217;s just flat-out</span><br />
<span>depressing!  So it behooves me to figure out how to make them serve</span><br />
<span>multiple duties.  One way to do that is to attract collaborators;</span><br />
<span>another is to serve as google bait for my lab; a third is to provide</span><br />
<span>my grad students with well-laid-out PhD projects.  A fourth duty they</span><br />
<span>serve (and I swear this was unintentional) is to point out to people</span><br />
<span>that this is MY turf and I&#8217;m already solving these problems, so maybe</span><br />
<span>they should go play in less occupied territory.  I know, very passive</span><br />
<span>aggressive&#8230;</span></p>

<p><span>So I posted the grants, and unknowingly joined a really awesome cadre</span><br />
<span>of folk who had already done the same</span><br />
<span>(</span><a href="http://jabberwocky.weecology.org/2012/08/10/a-list-of-publicly-available-grant-proposals-in-the-biological-sciences/" target="_blank"><a href="http://jabberwocky.weecology.org/2012/08/10/a-list-of-publicly-available-grant-proposals-in-the-biological-sciences/" target="_blank"><a href="http://jabberwocky.weecology.org/2012/08/10/a-list-of-publicly-available-grant-proposals-in-the-biological-sciences/">http://jabberwocky.weecology.org/2012/08/10/a-list-of-publicly-available-grant-proposals-in-the-biological-sciences/</a></a></a><span>).</span><br />
<span>Most feedback I&#8217;ve gotten has been from grad students and undergrads</span><br />
<span>who really appreciate the chance to look at grants; some people told</span><br />
<span>me that they&#8217;d been refused the chance to look at grants from their</span><br />
<span>own PIs!</span></p>

<p><span>At the end of the day, I&#8217;d be lucky to be relevant enough that people</span><br />
<span>want to steal my grants or my software (which, by the way, is under a</span><br />
<span>BSD license &#8212; free for the taking, no &#8220;theft&#8221; required&#8230;).  My</span><br />
<span>observation over the years is that most people will do just about</span><br />
<span>anything to avoid using other people&#8217;s software.</span></p>

<div class="im">
  <strong>In theoretical statistics, there is a tradition of publishing pre-prints while papers are submitted. Why do you think biology is lagging behind?</strong></p>
</div>

<p><span>I wish I knew!  There&#8217;s clearly a tradition of secrecy in biology;</span><br />
<span>just look at the Cold Spring Harbor rules re tweeting and blogging</span><br />
<span>(</span><a href="http://meetings.cshl.edu/report.html" target="_blank"><a href="http://meetings.cshl.edu/report.html" target="_blank"><a href="http://meetings.cshl.edu/report.html">http://meetings.cshl.edu/report.html</a></a></a><span>) - this is a conference, for</span><br />
<span>chrissakes, where you go to present and communicate!  I think it&#8217;s</span><br />
<span>self-destructive and leads to an insider culture where only those who</span><br />
<span>attend meetings and chat informally get to be members of the club,</span><br />
<span>which frankly slows down research. Given the societal and medical</span><br />
<span>challenges we face, this seems like a really bad way to continue doing</span><br />
<span>research.</span></p>

<p><span>One of the things I&#8217;m proudest of is our effort on the cephalopod</span><br />
<span>genome consortium&#8217;s white paper,</span><br />
<a href="http://ivory.idyll.org/blog/cephseq-cephalopod-genomics.html" target="_blank"><a href="http://ivory.idyll.org/blog/cephseq-cephalopod-genomics.html" target="_blank"><a href="http://ivory.idyll.org/blog/cephseq-cephalopod-genomics.html">http://ivory.idyll.org/blog/cephseq-cephalopod-genomics.html</a></a></a><span>, where a</span><br />
<span>group of bioinformaticians at the meeting pushed really hard to walk</span><br />
<span>the line between secrecy and openness.  I came away from that effort</span><br />
<span>thinking two things: first, that biologists were erring on the side of</span><br />
<span>risk aversity; and second, that genome database folk were smoking</span><br />
<span>crack when they pushed for complete openness of data.  (I have a blog</span><br />
<span>post on that last statement coming up at some point.)</span></p>

<p><span>The bottom line is that the incentives in academic biology are aligned</span><br />
<span>against openness.  In particular, you are often rewarded for the first</span><br />
<span>observation, not for the most useful one; if your data is used to do</span><br />
<span>cool stuff, you don&#8217;t get much if any credit; and it&#8217;s all about</span><br />
<span>first/last authorship and who is PI on the grants.  All too often this</span><br />
<span>means that people sit on their data endlessly.</span></p>

<p><span>This is getting particularly bad with next-gen data sets, because</span><br />
<span>anyone can generate them but most people have no idea how to analyze</span><br />
<span>their data, and so they just sit on it forever&#8230;</span></p>

  <strong>Do you think the ArXiv model will catch on in biology or just within the bioinformatics community?</strong></p>
</div>

<p><span>One of my favorite quotes is: &#8220;Making predictions is hard, especially</span><br />
<span>when they&#8217;re about the future.&#8221; I attribute it to Niels Bohr.</span></p>

<p><span>It&#8217;ll take a bunch of big, important scientists to lead the way. We</span><br />
<span>need key members of each subcommunity of biology to decide to do it on</span><br />
<span>a regular basis. (At this point I will take the obligatory cheap shot</span><br />
<span>and point out that Jonathan Eisen, noted open access fan, doesn&#8217;t post</span><br />
<span>his stuff to preprint servers very often.  What&#8217;s up with that?)  It&#8217;s</span><br />
<span>going to be a long road.</span></p>

<div class="im">
  <strong>What is the reaction you most commonly get when you tell people you have posted your un-funded grants online?</strong></p>
</div>

<p><span>&#8220;Ohmigod what if someone steals them?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span>Nobody has come up with a really convincing model for why posting</span><br />
<span>grants is a bad thing.  They&#8217;re just worried that it <em>might</em> be.  I</span><br />
<span>get the vague concerns about theft, but I have a hard time figuring</span><br />
<span>out exactly how it would work out well for the thief &#8212; reputation is</span><br />
<span>a big deal in science, and gossip would inevitably happen.  And at</span><br />
<span>least in bioinformatics I&#8217;m aiming to be well enough known that</span><br />
<span>straight up ripping me off would be suicidal.  Plus, if reviewers</span><br />
<span>do/did google searches on key concepts then my grants would pop up,</span><br />
<span>right?  I just don&#8217;t see it being a path to fame and glory for anyone.</span></p>

<p><span>Revisiting the passive-aggressive nature of my grant posting, I&#8217;d like</span><br />
<span>to point out that most of my grants depend on preliminary results from</span><br />
<span>our own algorithms.  So even if they want to compete on my turf, it&#8217;ll</span><br />
<span>be on a foundation I laid.  I&#8217;m fine with that &#8212; more citations for</span><br />
<span>me, either way :).</span></p>

<p><span>More optimistically, I really hope that people read my grants and then</span><br />
<span>find new (and better!) ways of solving the problems posed in them.  My</span><br />
<span>goal is to enable better science, not to hunker down in a tenured job</span><br />
<span>and engage in irrelevant science; if someone else can use my grants as</span><br />
<span>a positive or negative signpost to make progress, then broadly</span><br />
<span>speaking, my job is done.</span></p>

<p><span>Or, to look at it another way: I don&#8217;t have a good model for either</span><br />
<span>the possible risks OR the possible rewards of posting the grants, and</span><br />
<span>my inclinations are towards openness, so I thought I&#8217;d see what</span><br />
<span>happens.</span></p>

  <strong>How can junior researchers correct misunderstandings about open access/journals like PLoS One that separate correctness from impact? Do you have any concrete ideas for changing minds of senior folks who aren&#8217;t convinced?</strong></p>
</div>

<p><span>Render them irrelevant by becoming senior researchers who supplant them</span><br />
<span>when they retire.  It&#8217;s the academic tradition, after all!  And it&#8217;s</span><br />
<span>really the only way within the current academic system, which &#8212; for</span><br />
<span>better or for worse &#8212; isn&#8217;t going anywhere.</span></p>

<p><span>Honestly, we need fewer people yammering on about open access and more</span><br />
<span>people simply doing awesome science and submitting it to OA journals.</span><br />
<span>Conveniently, many of the high impact journals are shooting themselves</span><br />
<span>in the foot and encouraging this by rejecting good science that then</span><br />
<span>ends up in an OA journal; that wonderful ecology oped on PLoS One</span><br />
<span>citation rates shows this well</span><br />

  <strong>Do you have any advice on what computing skills/courses statistics students interested in next generation sequencing should take?</strong></p>
</div>

<p><span>For courses, no &#8212; in my opinion 80% of what any good researcher</span><br />
<span>learns is self-motivated and often self-taught, and so it&#8217;s almost</span><br />
<span>silly to pretend that any particular course or set of skills is</span><br />
<span>sufficient or even useful enough to warrant a whole course.  I&#8217;m not a</span><br />
<span>big fan of our current undergrad educational system <img src="http://simplystatistics.org/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></span></p>

<p><span>For skills?  You need critical thinking coupled with an awareness that</span><br />
<span>a lot of smart people have worked in science, and odds are that there</span><br />
<span>are useful tricks and approaches that you can use.  So talk to other</span><br />
<span>people, a lot!  My lab has a mix of biologists, computer scientists,</span><br />
<span>graph theorists, bioinformaticians, and physicists; more labs should</span><br />
<span>be like that.</span></p>

<p><span>Good programming skills are going to serve you well no matter what, of</span><br />
<span>course.  But I know plenty of good programmers who aren&#8217;t very</span><br />
<span>knowledgeable about biology, and who run into problems doing actual</span><br />
<span>science.  So it&#8217;s not a panacea.</span></p>

<p><strong><span>How does replicable or reproducible research fit into your interests?</span></strong></p>

<p><span>I&#8217;ve wasted <em>so much time</em> reproducing other people&#8217;s work that when</span><br />
<span>the opportunity came up to put down a marker, I took it.</span></p>

<p><a href="http://ivory.idyll.org/blog/replication-i.html" target="_blank"><a href="http://ivory.idyll.org/blog/replication-i.html" target="_blank"><a href="http://ivory.idyll.org/blog/replication-i.html">http://ivory.idyll.org/blog/replication-i.html</a></a></a></p>

<p><span>The digital normalization paper shouldn&#8217;t have been particularly</span><br />
<span>radical; that it is tells you all you need to know about replication</span><br />
<span>in computational biology.</span></p>

<p><span>This is actually something I first did a long time ago, with what was</span><br />
<span>perhaps my favorite pre-faculty-job paper: if you look at the methods</span><br />
<span>for </span><span class="il">Brown</span><span> &amp; Callan (2004) you&#8217;ll find a downloadable package that</span><br />
<span>contains all of the source code for the paper itself and the analysis</span><br />
<span>scripts.  But back then I didn&#8217;t blog :).</span></p>

<p><span>Lack of reproducibility and openness in methods has serious</span><br />
<span>consequences &#8212; how much of cancer research has been useless, for</span><br />
<span>example?  See <code>this horrific report&lt;/span&gt;  
&lt;span&gt;&lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052970203764804577059841672541590.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052970203764804577059841672541590.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052970203764804577059841672541590.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;&gt;</code>__.)</span><br />
<span>Again, the incentives are all wrong: you get grant money for</span><br />
<span>publishing, not for being useful.  The two are not necessarily the</span><br />
<span>same&#8230;</span></p>

<p><strong><span>Do you have a family, and how do you balance work life and home life?</span></strong></p>

<p><span>Why, thank you for asking!  I do have a family &#8212; my wife, Tracy Teal,</span><br />
<span>is a bioinformatician and microbial ecologist, and we have two</span><br />
<span>wonderful daughters, Amarie (4) and Jessie (1).  It&#8217;s not easy being a</span><br />
<span>junior professor and a parent at the same time, and I keep on trying</span><br />
<span>to figure out how to balance the needs of travel with the need to be a</span><br />
<span>parent (hint: I&#8217;m not good at it).  I&#8217;m increasingly leaning towards</span><br />
<span>blogging as being a good way to have an impact while being around</span><br />
<span>more; we&#8217;ll see how that goes.</span></p>
