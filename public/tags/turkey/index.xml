      <description>Over the Thanksgiving recent break I naturally started thinking about reproducible research in between salting the turkey and making the turkey stock. Clearly, these things are all related. I sometimes get the sense that many people see reproducibility as essentially binary. A published paper is either reproducible, as in you can compute every single last numerical result to within epsilon precision, or it&amp;#8217;s not. My feeling is that there is a spectrum of reproducibility when it comes to published scientific findings.</description>
