      <description>A really nice list of journals software/data release policies from Titus&amp;#8217; blog. Interesting that he couldn&amp;#8217;t find a data/release policy for the New England Journal of Medicine. I wonder if that is because it publishes mostly clinical studies, where the data are often protected for privacy reasons? It seems like there is going to eventually be a big discussion of the relative importance of privacy and open data in the clinical world.</description>

      <description>It seems like half of the battle in statistics is identifying an important/unsolved problem. In math, this is easy, they have a list. So why is it harder for statistics? Since I have to think up projects to work on for my research group, for classes I teach, and for exams we give, I have spent some time thinking about ways that research problems in statistics arise.
I borrowed a page out of Roger&amp;#8217;s book and made a little diagram to illustrate my ideas (actually I can&amp;#8217;t even claim credit, it was Roger&amp;#8217;s idea to make the diagram).</description>

      <title>Statistics project ideas for students</title>

      <description>Here are a few ideas that might make for interesting student projects at all levels (from high-school to graduate school). I&amp;#8217;d welcome ideas/suggestions/additions to the list as well. All of these ideas depend on free or scraped data, which means that anyone can work on them. I&amp;#8217;ve given a ballpark difficulty for each project to give people some idea.
Happy data crunching!
Data Collection/Synthesis
 Creating a webpage that explains conceptual statistical issues like randomization, margin of error, overfitting, cross-validation, concepts in data visualization, sampling.</description>
